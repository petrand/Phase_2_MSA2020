  Well, I tried – I really Tried.<br>But it turns out my expectations were way too high.<br>I was mesmerized by the commercials, captivated with visions of my gruff, electronically-brazened voice calling out over the speaker “Hey! Whutter you doin’ on my porch! Put that package down, the police are on their way!”<br>But it doesn’t work that way out here in Suburbia, not in the real world.<br>Oh, I tried, I really tried. I poured through the meek User Guide that came with the kit, graduated to the FAQs on the Ring website, and made so many calls to Ring Tech Support that I cringed each time in expectation that Ring would announce “You’re exceeded your limit!” But of course, they didn’t. They patiently answered my questions, helped me understand about 30-second versus 60-second video clips and the lag or buffering issue and zones and sensitivity. I learned about Device Health and Speed Test and download and upload speeds.<br>I moved my mailbox out of the way of the video doorbell. I bought a new porchlight that didn’t cast its ubiquitous glow onto the doorbell. I climbed into a 110-degre attic, swam through an ocean of blown-in insulation to find and replace a doorbell transformer. Because who among us has the tools or the skills to measure the output voltage of your doorbell wires? BTW, your local hardware store does not stock a doorbell transformer that matches the exact specs of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, I had to order one online.<br>From a patient cable internet technician, I learned about updating the firmware on my wireless router (“You gotta do this 1, 2 times a year!”). But it was worth it, because now my download and upload speeds are in what Ring calls “the Good Range”. I also purchased and installed the Ring Chime Pro, even though my house is what I would call Small by today’s standards – under1,000 sq. ft.<br>But none of that helped. Even though when I go to Live View and can see all of my yard in vivid color (or stark black-and-white at night) and see every twig movement and hear far-away roosters crow, it still won’t detect and alert me to a person walking up my driveway, until they are actually standing on my porch directly in front of the camera. Oh, it will do it once in a while, maybe twice in a while, but it won’t do it every time, it won’t do it even a majority of the time. The only time it does it 100% is when the person is actually standing on my porch. I am confident that an intruder could roam my yard at will, do as they will to the cars in my driveway, as long as they don’t climb onto my porch. Well, I can go to Live View and watch every movement, but the Ring Video Doorbell Pro will NOT detect and alert me.<br>And that myth about me actually speaking to the person on the porch? Well, the ghost of that ship has done sailed, honey, far out into the sunset and ne’er to return. Only the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Home Improvement Salesmen are willing to stay on my porch after they have rung the doorbell, waiting while it takes 10-15 seconds for the alert to hit my phone, and then the 2-5 minutes it takes for the video to become available for me to view. So no, my expectations were not met.<br>So, I will keep the new porch light, my wife likes it better than the old one. And I should have moved that mailbox long ago, it is much easier to empty in its new location. And I’ll keep the new doorbell transformer, it is a sturdy, handsome fellow even though it is buried beneath an AC return duct and 16 inches of powder insulation.<br>But my old doorbell is going back on my porch, and this Ring Video Doorbell Pro is going back to Amazon. It is too unreliable, and does not, can not, WILL NOT work as advertised.

  When I first got the device in July we immediately installed the product. Install went great and was super easy. For the first month the product worked great. We were super happy with it and even purchased the extra service through them to save our videos for longer. Shortly after that we started getting constant motion detection alerts. Sometimes it was something blowing by but more frequently it was simply the camera shifting from night vision to day vision for no apparent reason triggering a motion detection alert. Then for whatever reason in the end of September it simply quit working.<br><br>I have tried to contact the company but was told that I needed to verify the make and model of my chimes (only have make no model on them). They said there was nothing they could do. Now I am stuck with a doorbell that doesn't work and service I can't use because they couldn't verify the chime compatibility. Nowhere in the installation instructions was their anything about a chime compatibility and I am not sure that has anything to do with why it quit working.<br><br>Save your money and don't buy anything from a company who doesn't stand behind their product.

  This works well. The install is easy. I have one very major complaint. The blurb on Amazon does not explain that you have to pay for a cloud subscription to store and retrieve the short videos of motion events. The promotional material and install instructions are structured such that you do not catch this ¨gotcha"" until the unit is installed and you use it for a day or 2. There is no provision to store these videos locally on your own computer. I am giving this just one star because they are not up front about the need for a paid subscription and the lack of a local event video storage option.

  [October 2018 Update]<br>Revisiting my review once again, making it 4 stars.  My doorbell would randomly die after someone pressed it, rendering it useless until I reset the power.  I decided to reach out to Ring and after a very brief conversation they offered to send me a replacement device right away.  Once I received it, I quickly noticed that it was the same in the front but completely different hardware in the back.  I swapped out the old (sent it back to Ring), installed and setup the new (very easy to do by yourself), and for the past month+ it has been working very well.  None of the issues I had been experiencing with the original unit have since resurfaced with this new unit.<br><br>I'm glad I decided to reach out to Ring for support on this and was very appreciative of the support I incurred including the replacement device.<br><br>[JUNE 2018 UPDATE]<br>Well, my Ring Doorbell Pro died this week.  It had gone offline about 3 months ago... then again about a month ago... and now it's completely dead.  Previously I would go through the reset / setup procedure and it would come back online.  Now there's no lights, etc.  Apparently it's a ""known issue"" according to Ring.  Read the numerous reviews here.<br><br>I understand electronics are not necessarily meant to last forever, but a $250 weather sealed doorbell that sits in a sheltered environment should last much longer than 2 years.  In addition, the fact that Ring claims it's a ""known issue"" means that they are aware of a design flaw.  The flaw could be hardware or software, but a flaw means it's their fault.<br><br>However, since they only provide a 1 year warranty, I suppose that makes it my fault..  Not a single person who's reviewed this issue and had any luck with support on this issue.<br><br>Support did call me back to advise me to disconnect and reconnect the ring pro to see if that would work. Others who have tried this indicate that it's just a matter of time before it will fail again though. I had to try 3 times before it properly reset.<br><br>I'm not going to hold my breath.  Buyer beware - if you have money to burn, it's a fantastic device while it is working.  I for one will do my research and see if there's a better alternative available while I wait to see if this one dies.<br><br>[ORIGINAL REVIEW]<br>One day while I was out running an errand my ring app on my phone notified me that someone was ringing the doorbell.  I don't always answer, but decided to.  The young man at my door seemed a bit 'off' and asked for ""Nick"".  There's no one named Nick on my street... or in the small area where I live.  I told him he had the wrong house and the guy left.  Few minutes later I could not shake that something was off, so I reviewed the entire video footage - Ring captures motion so I was able to see what he did prior to ringing the doorbell.  This guy was wearing a hoodie so he covered his hands, looked through my front door window for a good 5+ seconds, then started to check the door to see if perhaps it was open, before deciding to ring the doorbell... all with his hands covered.  It was 70 degrees out.  Once I answered, he seemed shocked and he quickly pulled up his hood.<br><br>I contacted the police and they filed a report.  I shared my Ring video with them and they said it was the cleanest video they had seen in some time.  Less than two weeks later a detective called me to let me know that the guy who came to my door was indeed looking to burglarize my home.  He had been arrested and put in jail for other area burglaries.  The detective said that had I not answered the doorbell, my home would most certainly have been broken into that day.<br><br>I've had the ring doorbell since September 2016 and this was the first and only time something odd/suspicious was captured and, to say the least, it works!!!<br><br>Now onto some of the issues I've had:<br>1.  Ring initially was recording very poorly and sometimes would not capture video properly if at all.  I installed a high end wifi extender nearby and problems went away.  Previously my wifi signal strength was about 40% at the doorbell location.  Now it's close to 100%.<br>2.  My Ring doorbell went offline and it took me who knows how long to realize it.  The app has a health monitor - RING why are you not telling me that you're offline???  Why do I need to discover it for myself????  Getting it back online was a bit of a hassle also.<br>3.  Angle.  I now see some angled plates for sale but would have liked to have had those when I installed it.  It's perpendicular to my door, which means I am not capturing as much motion as I would like.  Someone needs to be on my porch before it starts capturing motion.  With an angled plate, I could catch them coming up my walkway instead, which is more useful.<br>4.  Costs $30/year to maintain recordings.  If I install additional devices, it's an additional $30 per device.  Would have liked to get a price break.<br><br>Overall, great product.  Not sure I've seen a better one on the market.  As with any tech, there are always likely to be issues somewhere.  Overall, I think this is a good product and well worth the peace of mind.

   I bought this doorbell since I had gotten tired of finding beer botttles and bags of weed (I kid you not) on my front lawn.  And the fact that I installed tint on my front door (since it's made of glass and I didn't have privacy) and couldn't see who was coming to the door anymore.  And to ensure receipt of Amazon's finest.  And catch package thieves.<br><br>PROS:<br><br>I'm so glad I didn't buy Amazon's doorbell installation kit.  Why? Because the tutorial setup was broken down Barney style and it was so simple and easy to use.  I was able to easily determine my doorbell was a mechanical one, and how to find the required voltage for the Ring doorbell to run smoothly.<br><br>It was so simple to install the additional wiring to the bell, and then attach the Ring device where the doorbell is supposed to be.  They have all the tools needed included in the kit.  BY THE WAY, YOU CAN PULL OUT THE PHILIPS SCREW AND TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN SO YOU CAN SCREW IN THE SECURITY SCREW FOR THE RING DEVICE.  I was looking all over the place for a tool to screw it in, and just when I was about to run to the local hardware store, I was messing with the screw and realized it had another end.<br><br>Face palm.<br><br>The video was running in 780p (when it worked properly) and it was fantastic to adjust the motion settings and set zones so that not every passing car or falling leaves would trigger an alert/recording event.<br><br>The Cons<br><br>My router modem is about 5 ft away from the door so I didn't see any reason to go buy the Wi Fi extender but sometimes the video playback would have green flashing across the screen or become very choppy.<br><br>Furthermore, on some rare occasions, there seems to be some videos that I can't open and play at all.<br><br>The talk interface seems to be kind of hushed as well, my visitors needed me to almost yell to make out what I am saying, which is hard on a pretty busy street.<br><br>Other than that, I think this is a very solid security camera/doorbell and I'd definitely recommend it over the Sky Doorbell.<br><br>Edit 1/17/18:<br><br>Over time, I have not experienced the green screen for the camera anymore.  In fact, I was able to capture some pretty good quality shots of the porch pirate stealing our packages over Christmas (see vattched video).<br><br>Sometimes the mic would still seem muffled during two way, and my only other complaint is that it still seems to load up slow when I’m answering a door bell.  So I would just grab a baseball bat and open the door rather than wait for it to load up the camera.

  I have had a very disappointing experience with my Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  When it was installed, I had some customer service issues which were fixed quickly. Then after a few days, the unit continually dropped it's signal and didn't work.  I would reboot it, as instructed and repeatedly within 24 hours I would lose the signal again.  Finally, the unit lost power completely.  Every time I called their customer service, they ran me through the same circus of reboots, despite the fact I told them the battery was drained and although the unit was connected to power, it was not working.  I've made 5 calls to their customer service department with long waits on hold and the same scripted 'fix' that has not worked.  At this point, I will be returning the doorbell &amp; stick up cam to Amazon for a refund of a defective product that Ring does seem to want to support.

It's advertising promises the ability to pre-screen visitors and even communicate to them when you aren’t at home.  However, real-world results vary wildly and it's so glitchy that you'll regularly find it impossible to replicate their commercials.<br><br>Often, the phone notifications arrive well after the doorbell rings or motion is detected, or the app refuses to initiate an active connection to the doorbell camera for so long the person has already left before video starts up.

  I have had my Ring Doorbell Pro for just under 2 weeks.  Last week we were on vacation so I figured it was the perfect time to buy and test it out within the 30 day trial period.  I’ll split this review into 3 bits.  First impressions, Install, and Operational Use.<br><br>1) First Impressions.  We have a security system installed but didn’t go with their camera system because it was CCTV and I wanted something with an internet connection or way to access it from my phone.  While making small talk with the security system guy, I mentioned the Ring to him.  He was super excited to get out his phone and show me that he has one.  He said he couldn’t buy any camera with nearly that quality at that price even with his discounts.  He spoke so highly of it I was sure that’s what I wanted to get.  We want to do a whole system with cameras on the back of the house, but we purchased the Ring Pro to see how we liked it before we commit to buying everything.<br><br>I went with the Ring Pro over the Original Ring because I was going to be wiring it in place anyway.  I also like the slender profile and the possibility to use wireless 5.0 in the future if I desire. Plus I live on a very busy road and wanted the advanced motion detection zones on the pro.  Since I did my research, I was aware that the Ring Pro has a 160 degree field of view compared to the 180 degree view of the original.  For this reason, I purchased fiberglass shims to angle it more towards my large 6 foot doors when I installed it.<br><br>I talked with Ring customer service and asked if there was any advantage to ordering through them versus Amazon and they said there were none, so I went with Amazon for my Prime shipping and additional protections of ordering through Amazon.<br><br>2) Install.  I was a bit intimidated with the install as I’ve never wired anything up before and our house is new construction.  But the YouTube video and pamphlets made it pretty clear to follow.  They also emphasize that you can call them at any point for assistance.  I had also been told by the security system guy that install was super easy and I could do it myself (he’s also the one who gave me the tip about the fiberglass shims).  He also gave me an extra tidbit for those of us with stone or brick exteriors: drill into the grout lines – they drill easy; stone does not.<br><br>I started with the extra power pack that gets installed inside and connected to your door chime.  It was the more complex part of the installation and involved a very tall ladder but it went well.  I was impressed that the ring doorbell came with everything you need to install it – including the drill bit AND a screw driver. It even has extra bits you MIGHT need (like extensions wires and extra screws).  I also really appreciated how everything was in separate baggies for which part of the install you were doing and was very well labeled (extras were labeled as extras, pro kit wires in one bag, doorbell wires and screws in another).  I was unable to fit the power kit inside my chime housing but it doesn’t look bad attached to the wall just outside the chime housing (see picture).  It’s just a bit larger than a matchbox.<br><br>Installing the actual ring was even easier.  I was able to drill into grout lines between stones so I had that going for me.  The hook up was super easy, two wires from the house connect to the two connectors on the Ring – doesn’t even matter which is which.  Nice and easy. I will have to work out something to cover the shimmed side, but I’ll work something out.<br><br>Set up was easy and step-by-step.  I was concerned when it was downloading the new firmware and updates and then rebooted because the light was off for (what felt like) a long time (maybe 5 minutes).  But it all went flawlessly.<br><br>3)  Operational Use.  I like being able to set up polygons for the motion detection zones.  I was able to easily mark my drive way, flowerbeds and porch.  I’ve never had a problem with the busy traffic from the road (something the security guy mentioned was a problem with his original Ring).  There are two problems they need to work out:  You will get a motion detect when the night vision clicks on in the evening and when it clicks off in the morning.  Expect that.<br><br>Also, this is not a miracle product.  It will only work as well as your internet connection.  That means a little lag if you’re on a cable connection at peak times.  There are a few times I’ve had the video come up in laggy and weirdly pixilated forms that took a second to work out.  I’ve also noticed our voice connection is VERY quiet.  As in, the person at the door can barely hear the person on the phone, so I consider that feature a bit useless.  We managed to scare our cat sitter from the other side of the country and greet my mom, but I wouldn’t rely on it for communicating with people often.  We managed to talk to our lawn service but we had to yell into the phone and they had to ask us to repeat ourselves a few times.  Also we live on such a busy road that there is a lot of noise which makes the video sound very choppy. So again, I just consider this feature a novelty and not something to rely on.<br><br>I mentioned a cat sitter.  It was kind of awesome to be able to see that she came by every day.  In fact, the first day she didn’t come by until 11:00pm and I worriedly texted her to see if she was going to come.  Every other day I took solace in knowing that she had already stopped by without having to text her or fear her shed forget.  I was able to see when the lawn service came by and did their thing.  I was able to see when packages were delivered and when my mom brought the nephews up to use the pool.  I also got to scare the crap out of our friend as they were leaving our empty house and I wished them goodnight.  That was worth some money right there.  I even caught a few people using my driveway to turn around.<br><br>My favorite bit was the unexpected bonus video of my husband going outside to inspect my work.  I’m keeping that one.<br><br>It catches us leaving for work every day and coming home.  It catches me when I go to fill the bird feeders.  I’ve not had it miss any movement that I’m aware of.  If you have motion sensors on, expect more notifications than you think you will get.  As said, you’ll get the two from nightfall and sunrise.  Plus I get two from me departing for work and my husband departing plus 2 more for each of us coming home.  Add on more for checking the mail and anything you may do in the yard.  This is where not being limited on storage size is handy.  The cloud storage is $30 per year and it keeps videos for 6 months.  It doesn’t say anything about size so having these extra videos doesn’t bother me.  I find the video quality to be great and I can easily identify who is at the door night and day.<br><br>I also like that it came with a decal showing that the house is monitored.  I placed this prominently in my front window along with our security monitoring service decal.  Avoiding bad guys is worth more than catching them.<br><br>I feel like this was a great purchase.  The price is excellent.  I love being able to access it anytime from my phone.  I love knowing what is going on at my house even when I’m on vacation.  I love the security aspect both in surveillance and as a deterrent.  It looks sharp (see photo).  It’s also a lot of fun.  I’ve shown it off to many friends and coworkers, at least one of which decided to get one themselves.<br><br>4) Summary.  CONS: Only as good as your internet connection.  Sunrise and sunset motion detects.  Sound quality is useless in my experience.  PROS:  Access from anywhere, anytime.  Surveillance and deterrent.  Motion zones let you cut out areas you don’t care to monitor (neighbors yard, roads, ect).  Great price.<br><br>As a camera only, I would give this 5+ stars, easy.  I deducted 1 star because they heavily play up the speaker aspect and that seems worthless in my experience with it.  I’m insanely happy with the purchase over all.  In the future I will probably buy a chime and a stick-up cam to go along with it.<br><br>UPDATE:  1 Year-On.  We have had the Ring Pro for One full year now.  I've also added two of the chime accessories.  I'm just as happy with it now as I was when I wrote this review.  We tried to trouble shoot the sound a few times and still have had no luck with it.  I think my unit might just be defective in that area.  However I still think if this was advertised as a camera only, it would be 100% worth the price and 5 stars.  I did have someone point out the sticker over the ring might be the cause of our sound problem, removing it didn't help.<br><br>Our indoor chime had the oddity of only ringing the first chime (rather than a series) after installation.  As our indoor chime was never loud enough anyway, we added two of the chime plug in accessories without even trying to trouble shoot.  We added one chime downstairs and one in our master bedroom.  We've been super happy with them as well.<br><br>UPDATE: 3.5 years later.  Still working. It stopped working for a while so I called customer service before I purchased a new one to make sure it wasn’t some power issue.  They sent me (for free) the version 2.0 power kit and the chime bypass kit.  Turned out the chime bypass kit fixed it.  I didn’t need the indoor mechanical chime anyway as I have two Ring Chime devices.  I used it this morning to tell the pest control guy the gate code without getting out of bed.  It’s been up 4 summers now.<br><br>I still look at it every week to see what animals were creeping in my yard at night.  Love the raccoons that come hang out on my porch some nights.<br><br>If this thing died tomorrow, I’d replace it with the exact same model, no regrets.

  I had high hopes for this products and company. Friends recommended it and didn't have any issue. Well the disappointment came. Power to the unit was good, connection was good and tested on 2 separate routers. Issues have been can't connect to doorbell for live feed, grainy video and shadowing when it occasionally worked. When attempting to view events it was a black screen, also, when there was a even that would be viewable it was just a still image with sound playing in the background. I trusted that their tech support could get it working. Had their level 2 tech support change settijngs around in the router, connect to 2.4 or 5gz channels with both routers. The issues continued. They sent a free chime pro, which is their wireless extender to see if it would help. It actually made the connection worse and the router is 1 foot from the doorbell. The previously sent a replacement ring pro which didn't help either. They have apparently have software problems that are not addressed. It should not be this difficult to get a product to work to get a little protection. Products will be returned.

  I've had this installed for a few weeks now.  My main reason for writing the review is to save some people the frustration of trying to figure out why the ring will not trigger your internal chime.  This is easy to install if you have an existing wired door bell.  It is easy to set up.  The video quality is good if you have a very strong wifi connection but even then can still be choppy at times when on live view and the two way audio lags and can be choppy.  Overall though it work well though.  My main issue was the the ring was intermittently triggering the internal chime.  I couldn't figure out why.  I reinstalled it twice and reset it a few times.  It was driving me crazy.  It would ring at night but not during the afternoon.  My doorbell gets blazing sun in the afternoon.  Turns out that there is some sort of safety mechanism that shuts down the internal chime when it gets to hot.  I wish I would have known this before I spent an extra hour or two trouble shooting it.  I can't imagine that my door is the only one that gets sun.  If this is a large issue the doorbell should ship with the plug in chime.

  This is one of my first reviews of a product and if I would have written this back when I got the device I would have give this 5 stars.  The quality, cloud support, customer service was top notch.  After July the video quality has gone downhill FAST.  Prior to all the firm ware updates I could make out people walking on my street at night as well as any of the critters running around my property.  After this, the video quality looks like I am playing a game of mine craft in the snow.  The picture is washed out, grainy, and choppy.  I am so dissapointed with the service.  I called/email customer service plenty of times.  Only to have been told it was my power pack, transformer, I needed a chime pro, and my internet reception wasn't that good, etc.  I replaced everything aside from disabling the actual doorbell which I am not going to do.  I was told my doorbell is not getting enough power when the device health says very good and I am getting a continuous 4100mV to the doorbell running on a brand new 24v transformer.  Also told I didn't have good WiFi signal at my door when my router is about 3 feet away from it and I am getting 200mb down/10mb up.  Finally customer service told me it was my Ring Doorbell that was faulty.  This is not the case b/c the doorbell they sent me was on firmware 1.3.7 which is about 8 firmwares old.  The video is amazing and the quality is how I remember it.  If there was a way I can never update my firmware I would be eager to learn if I could do that.  I have been saving screenshots from my old doorbell and the new one so i can use them as proof when the same thing happens.  The video from 2 weeks ago was 8megs and the one I took today was 24meg with only 5 seconds difference in time.  This pretty much confirmed my suspicions that Ring has been reducing the bitrate over each firmware.  So buyer beware as the commercials you see are in NO way close to what you get.  So dissapointed in this product as it was amazing 3 months ago and promoting it to everyone i came in contact with.  Now, not so much as I have taken to showing the drop in quality.  Fix the bitrate and I will change my review aside from that all this device is good for is alerting you when motion is detected and letting you know when someone rings the doorbell while you are away.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Ring Pro may not be compatible with your doorbell - WHAT?,151 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2017","<span>
  This would be my FOURTH Ring camera. I have three others around my house. but this was my first PRO one.<br>I was replacing my original Ring doorbell with this one, in the SAME spot with the SAME wires. This was has worked flawlessly for two year, but I wanted the better resolution that they Pro has.<br>Set up was easy like my other three. But note you need to install a kit INTO your Doorbell Chime box (see image), but don't worry that only takes a few minutes. NOW load the app to set up the WiFi, click the button on the side and NOTHING, no RING-### anything in my Wifi list. Remember this is my FOURTH Ring camera, The other three installed in minutes. I tried again, nothing in my Wifi list, then I tried an ipad, then a different iPhone, still not showing up in the WiFi list. Then I did a hard restart (hold the side button for over 15 secs) still nothing. I reboot my Router (ASUS), the same router that the other three work great with. Still Nothing. After searching Internet for ideas, I call Tech Support. The asked me to try pretty much everything I already did. After an hour, support said to return the Pro Ring and said its either BAD or not compatible with my doorbell chimes (Well my other Ring worked perfect with it).

  Wow...where do I begin?<br>This is a good product that has the potential to be GREAT!<br>I will say that this is the 2nd one I purchased as I had to return the 1st one. (The 1st one was purchased on Amazon through E Zone Electronics and they have been great to work with!)<br><br>So, 1st off let me say this.  I believe the reason the 1st one didn't work was because of a setting on my Netgear C7000 modem/router.  It's called BeamForming - BFE and BFR.  Once I turned that off, the 2nd Ring Pro connected almost flawlessly.  So keep that in mind.<br><br>So I don't really have anything additional to say about this as the other reviewers have done a great job of that.  It's a good product, professionally packaged (reminded me of how Apple packs things).  It included a very usable screw driver and drill bit (used for drilling into cement or brick).<br><br>Instructions were GREAT! and overall the experience (the 2nd one) was great!<br><br>So, do your homework 1st before ordering:<br>1: MEASURE the voltage AT the doorbell.  Just loosen the screws on your doorbell, put a voltage meter on it (set for AC) and you NEED to have 16v to 24v.  If you don't have it...replace your transformer. (I did.)<br><br>2: MEASURE the wifi signal strength at the doorbell.  Take your phone, download any of the free wifi SPEEDTEST tools (I use Ookla) and make sure you have good signal strength. How much?  According to Ring only 2 MBs up and down.  I have 65 Megs right at the doorbell and the video quality is excellent but the audio is poor.  Very quiet and choppy.<br><br>3: I'm having an issue which I'm hoping is just a setting, but when you push the button to ring the doorbell, it only rings on our phone and doesn't actually ring the old doorbell. (See pic)<br><br>So in a nutshell there you have it.  Is it worth $200?  Welllll....yeah, for now, it's okay. Hopefully soon it'll start to go down as I would love to purchase one for my daughter's house.<br><br>PS: I included a picture of the camera right after I installed it.  Also I included one of my OLD door bell (Buzzer actually)

  I bought this because I thought it was cool. It surprised me just how Awesome the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is!!! I had no prior experience with Ring doorbells or Video doorbells in general. This changed my world. Like a doorbell on steroids. Amazing just how much you can actually see from a camera about the size of a pencil eraser. And you don't just see you can have a conversation with whomever is at your door while you're anywhere. I was so impressed I bought another Ring doorbell about a week after installing and using this one. It is the talking point for everyone who comes to see our new home. I have been recommending to family and friends and talking about Ring in just about every conversation. My parents bought one based on my experience. I was nit picky giving 4 instead of 5 Stars and here is why. You need a very good WiFi signal for Ring to work as advertised. With less than excellent WiFi you might experience what some of the other reviewers complain about, lag. That is lag time from when someone presses your doorbell to when the alert comes up on the Ring App on your device. So if you have this issue and it persists check out your WiFi signal before bashing Ring. My new house has excellent WiFi signal and I have had zero issues now that our network is up and running. As Ring continues to update there software and App hopefully this will help alleviate lag as well. So use to view, talk, save to cloud, security, etc. I highly recommend for anyone. AWESOME!!!

  While I think the product is a great idea, don't buy this unless your porch is in the open and has lots of light. I've tried two separate units and neither has transitioned back from night mode to color the next day. I even left the porch light on 24 hours a day. I will be trying another brand that doesn't charge for cloud recording. I should have returned it right away, now I'm out the money because I kept corresponding with their customer service trying to fix it.

  I was hesitant to buy the Ring Video Doorbell Pro for two reasons: 1) the price is rather steep; and 2) the negative reviews were concerning. But, I am intrigued by the products and needed a security solution so I decided to try a Ring Video Cam first. I fell in love with the cams and ended up buying 3 to put around my property. All work flawless. So I decided I would then take the plunge and buy the Ring Doorbell Pro. I purchased it on March 3.<br><br>Installation - was pretty straight forward. If you've changed a light switch or done simple electrical work then the install shouldn't be an issue. Directions were straight forward and comprehensive enough.<br><br>Performance - from March 3 to March 6 the doorbell worked great. Good wifi, good voltage. Motion detection was awesome. If someone rang my doorbell I got the notification and could view the live video. Then on the afternoon of March 6 I got a notification that the doorbell had lost connectivity. And it has been a bumpy ride ever since.<br><br>Customer Service - I started exchanging emails with customer service. Apparently, all the issues I was experiencing had nothing to do with their perfect product, but everything to do with my lousy house.  It must be bad wiring or it must be bad wifi or it must be bad voltage transformer, etc... Even if you look at their support website, any issue you try to troubleshoot pretty much puts the blame on something in your house. For 4 weeks now I've had off and on exchanges with them and they offer zero real support and have yet to admit I may possibly have a defective device.<br><br>Today, April 5, I now have a $249 doorbell.  I cannot view any video. I do not receive any notifications when someone rings my doorbell. Yet, the doorbell reports perfect health - very good wifi connection, very good voltage readings. The doorbell works like a $3 doorbell from Home Depot - press the button and ding-dong and that is it.  I am trying to get it replaced with Ring, but to this day they still say ""perform a wifi test"" or some ridiculous thing like that.  I keep reminding them I have 3 other Ring cams around my property that all are on that same wifi and all work perfect.<br><br>This doorbell is a ding-dong for sure! Save your money for now until they develop a doorbell that actually works like it is supposed to.

  I purchased this with the thought that since it is wired to your existing doorbell, it did not require a battery.  After the 1 year warranty expired, my doorbell died.  After researching how to fix it, I found that there is indeed a battery inside the unit and once the battery dies, your video doorbell is useless.  There is no repairing this unless you ""mod"" the Ring.  I tried the mod and my Ring must be completely dead.  I am an electronic technician so I have enough experience with soldering components.  I'm very unhappy with this product and so are a lot of other people that this product has failed on them.  Do a search and look up Ring video doorbell pro died.  It seems to be right around a year to 18 months until it fails.  I can't see paying $249 every year for this.  I'll wait until they figure out how to remove the battery from the circuit.<br><br>Update: 12/12/2018  A Ring representative saw my review and reached out to me.  They are sending me a new doorbell to replace the defective one.  Although I am happy they are sending me a new doorbell, I seriously hope they have figured a way to keep this doorbell working for longer than 16 months.  I'll update this review as the process moves along.

  I have had problems with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro from day 1 ... it's now day 35 and counting.  Video often froze, sometimes nothing more than a black screen ... so rendered the unit pretty much useless.  Tech support was fairly responsive but seemed to go through a generic troubleshooting list when giving me things to check.  The doorbell was always less than 15 feet from my router.  WiFi signal strength and speed was well above what was required.  At Ring support's suggestion I switched from 5GHz to 2.4GHz, reset the unit several times, added a Ring Chime Pro wifi extender (they provided) but if anything the problems seem to have gotten worse.  I've been asking if it could be a defective unit ... yesterday Ring support concluded it may in fact be defective and is sending a replacement.  I will update this review depending on what happens after I replace my current one.<br>Too bad as I have otherwise had good experience with Stick Up Cam, Solar Panel and two Chimes that I installed around same time frame.

  Well, I tried – I really Tried.<br>But it turns out my expectations were way too high.<br>I was mesmerized by the commercials, captivated with visions of my gruff, electronically-brazened voice calling out over the speaker “Hey! Whutter you doin’ on my porch! Put that package down, the police are on their way!”<br>But it doesn’t work that way out here in Suburbia, not in the real world.<br>Oh, I tried, I really tried. I poured through the meek User Guide that came with the kit, graduated to the FAQs on the Ring website, and made so many calls to Ring Tech Support that I cringed each time in expectation that Ring would announce “You’re exceeded your limit!” But of course, they didn’t. They patiently answered my questions, helped me understand about 30-second versus 60-second video clips and the lag or buffering issue and zones and sensitivity. I learned about Device Health and Speed Test and download and upload speeds.<br>I moved my mailbox out of the way of the video doorbell. I bought a new porchlight that didn’t cast its ubiquitous glow onto the doorbell. I climbed into a 110-degre attic, swam through an ocean of blown-in insulation to find and replace a doorbell transformer. Because who among us has the tools or the skills to measure the output voltage of your doorbell wires? BTW, your local hardware store does not stock a doorbell transformer that matches the exact specs of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, I had to order one online.<br>From a patient cable internet technician, I learned about updating the firmware on my wireless router (“You gotta do this 1, 2 times a year!”). But it was worth it, because now my download and upload speeds are in what Ring calls “the Good Range”. I also purchased and installed the Ring Chime Pro, even though my house is what I would call Small by today’s standards – under1,000 sq. ft.<br>But none of that helped. Even though when I go to Live View and can see all of my yard in vivid color (or stark black-and-white at night) and see every twig movement and hear far-away roosters crow, it still won’t detect and alert me to a person walking up my driveway, until they are actually standing on my porch directly in front of the camera. Oh, it will do it once in a while, maybe twice in a while, but it won’t do it every time, it won’t do it even a majority of the time. The only time it does it 100% is when the person is actually standing on my porch. I am confident that an intruder could roam my yard at will, do as they will to the cars in my driveway, as long as they don’t climb onto my porch. Well, I can go to Live View and watch every movement, but the Ring Video Doorbell Pro will NOT detect and alert me.<br>And that myth about me actually speaking to the person on the porch? Well, the ghost of that ship has done sailed, honey, far out into the sunset and ne’er to return. Only the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Home Improvement Salesmen are willing to stay on my porch after they have rung the doorbell, waiting while it takes 10-15 seconds for the alert to hit my phone, and then the 2-5 minutes it takes for the video to become available for me to view. So no, my expectations were not met.<br>So, I will keep the new porch light, my wife likes it better than the old one. And I should have moved that mailbox long ago, it is much easier to empty in its new location. And I’ll keep the new doorbell transformer, it is a sturdy, handsome fellow even though it is buried beneath an AC return duct and 16 inches of powder insulation.<br>But my old doorbell is going back on my porch, and this Ring Video Doorbell Pro is going back to Amazon. It is too unreliable, and does not, can not, WILL NOT work as advertised.

  When I first got the device in July we immediately installed the product. Install went great and was super easy. For the first month the product worked great. We were super happy with it and even purchased the extra service through them to save our videos for longer. Shortly after that we started getting constant motion detection alerts. Sometimes it was something blowing by but more frequently it was simply the camera shifting from night vision to day vision for no apparent reason triggering a motion detection alert. Then for whatever reason in the end of September it simply quit working.<br><br>I have tried to contact the company but was told that I needed to verify the make and model of my chimes (only have make no model on them). They said there was nothing they could do. Now I am stuck with a doorbell that doesn't work and service I can't use because they couldn't verify the chime compatibility. Nowhere in the installation instructions was their anything about a chime compatibility and I am not sure that has anything to do with why it quit working.<br><br>Save your money and don't buy anything from a company who doesn't stand behind their product.

  This works well. The install is easy. I have one very major complaint. The blurb on Amazon does not explain that you have to pay for a cloud subscription to store and retrieve the short videos of motion events. The promotional material and install instructions are structured such that you do not catch this ¨gotcha"" until the unit is installed and you use it for a day or 2. There is no provision to store these videos locally on your own computer. I am giving this just one star because they are not up front about the need for a paid subscription and the lack of a local event video storage option.

  [October 2018 Update]<br>Revisiting my review once again, making it 4 stars.  My doorbell would randomly die after someone pressed it, rendering it useless until I reset the power.  I decided to reach out to Ring and after a very brief conversation they offered to send me a replacement device right away.  Once I received it, I quickly noticed that it was the same in the front but completely different hardware in the back.  I swapped out the old (sent it back to Ring), installed and setup the new (very easy to do by yourself), and for the past month+ it has been working very well.  None of the issues I had been experiencing with the original unit have since resurfaced with this new unit.<br><br>I'm glad I decided to reach out to Ring for support on this and was very appreciative of the support I incurred including the replacement device.<br><br>[JUNE 2018 UPDATE]<br>Well, my Ring Doorbell Pro died this week.  It had gone offline about 3 months ago... then again about a month ago... and now it's completely dead.  Previously I would go through the reset / setup procedure and it would come back online.  Now there's no lights, etc.  Apparently it's a ""known issue"" according to Ring.  Read the numerous reviews here.<br><br>I understand electronics are not necessarily meant to last forever, but a $250 weather sealed doorbell that sits in a sheltered environment should last much longer than 2 years.  In addition, the fact that Ring claims it's a ""known issue"" means that they are aware of a design flaw.  The flaw could be hardware or software, but a flaw means it's their fault.<br><br>However, since they only provide a 1 year warranty, I suppose that makes it my fault..  Not a single person who's reviewed this issue and had any luck with support on this issue.<br><br>Support did call me back to advise me to disconnect and reconnect the ring pro to see if that would work. Others who have tried this indicate that it's just a matter of time before it will fail again though. I had to try 3 times before it properly reset.<br><br>I'm not going to hold my breath.  Buyer beware - if you have money to burn, it's a fantastic device while it is working.  I for one will do my research and see if there's a better alternative available while I wait to see if this one dies.<br><br>[ORIGINAL REVIEW]<br>One day while I was out running an errand my ring app on my phone notified me that someone was ringing the doorbell.  I don't always answer, but decided to.  The young man at my door seemed a bit 'off' and asked for ""Nick"".  There's no one named Nick on my street... or in the small area where I live.  I told him he had the wrong house and the guy left.  Few minutes later I could not shake that something was off, so I reviewed the entire video footage - Ring captures motion so I was able to see what he did prior to ringing the doorbell.  This guy was wearing a hoodie so he covered his hands, looked through my front door window for a good 5+ seconds, then started to check the door to see if perhaps it was open, before deciding to ring the doorbell... all with his hands covered.  It was 70 degrees out.  Once I answered, he seemed shocked and he quickly pulled up his hood.<br><br>I contacted the police and they filed a report.  I shared my Ring video with them and they said it was the cleanest video they had seen in some time.  Less than two weeks later a detective called me to let me know that the guy who came to my door was indeed looking to burglarize my home.  He had been arrested and put in jail for other area burglaries.  The detective said that had I not answered the doorbell, my home would most certainly have been broken into that day.<br><br>I've had the ring doorbell since September 2016 and this was the first and only time something odd/suspicious was captured and, to say the least, it works!!!<br><br>Now onto some of the issues I've had:<br>1.  Ring initially was recording very poorly and sometimes would not capture video properly if at all.  I installed a high end wifi extender nearby and problems went away.  Previously my wifi signal strength was about 40% at the doorbell location.  Now it's close to 100%.<br>2.  My Ring doorbell went offline and it took me who knows how long to realize it.  The app has a health monitor - RING why are you not telling me that you're offline???  Why do I need to discover it for myself????  Getting it back online was a bit of a hassle also.<br>3.  Angle.  I now see some angled plates for sale but would have liked to have had those when I installed it.  It's perpendicular to my door, which means I am not capturing as much motion as I would like.  Someone needs to be on my porch before it starts capturing motion.  With an angled plate, I could catch them coming up my walkway instead, which is more useful.<br>4.  Costs $30/year to maintain recordings.  If I install additional devices, it's an additional $30 per device.  Would have liked to get a price break.<br><br>Overall, great product.  Not sure I've seen a better one on the market.  As with any tech, there are always likely to be issues somewhere.  Overall, I think this is a good product and well worth the peace of mind.

  I have had a very disappointing experience with my Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  When it was installed, I had some customer service issues which were fixed quickly. Then after a few days, the unit continually dropped it's signal and didn't work.  I would reboot it, as instructed and repeatedly within 24 hours I would lose the signal again.  Finally, the unit lost power completely.  Every time I called their customer service, they ran me through the same circus of reboots, despite the fact I told them the battery was drained and although the unit was connected to power, it was not working.  I've made 5 calls to their customer service department with long waits on hold and the same scripted 'fix' that has not worked.

  I have had my Ring Doorbell Pro for just under 2 weeks.  Last week we were on vacation so I figured it was the perfect time to buy and test it out within the 30 day trial period.  I’ll split this review into 3 bits.  First impressions, Install, and Operational Use.<br><br>1) First Impressions.  We have a security system installed but didn’t go with their camera system because it was CCTV and I wanted something with an internet connection or way to access it from my phone.  While making small talk with the security system guy, I mentioned the Ring to him.  He was super excited to get out his phone and show me that he has one.  He said he couldn’t buy any camera with nearly that quality at that price even with his discounts.  He spoke so highly of it I was sure that’s what I wanted to get.  We want to do a whole system with cameras on the back of the house, but we purchased the Ring Pro to see how we liked it before we commit to buying everything.<br><br>I went with the Ring Pro over the Original Ring because I was going to be wiring it in place anyway.  I also like the slender profile and the possibility to use wireless 5.0 in the future if I desire. Plus I live on a very busy road and wanted the advanced motion detection zones on the pro.  Since I did my research, I was aware that the Ring Pro has a 160 degree field of view compared to the 180 degree view of the original.  For this reason, I purchased fiberglass shims to angle it more towards my large 6 foot doors when I installed it.<br><br>I talked with Ring customer service and asked if there was any advantage to ordering through them versus Amazon and they said there were none, so I went with Amazon for my Prime shipping and additional protections of ordering through Amazon.<br><br>2) Install.  I was a bit intimidated with the install as I’ve never wired anything up before and our house is new construction.  But the YouTube video and pamphlets made it pretty clear to follow.  They also emphasize that you can call them at any point for assistance.  I had also been told by the security system guy that install was super easy and I could do it myself (he’s also the one who gave me the tip about the fiberglass shims).  He also gave me an extra tidbit for those of us with stone or brick exteriors: drill into the grout lines – they drill easy; stone does not.<br><br>I started with the extra power pack that gets installed inside and connected to your door chime.  It was the more complex part of the installation and involved a very tall ladder but it went well.  I was impressed that the ring doorbell came with everything you need to install it – including the drill bit AND a screw driver. It even has extra bits you MIGHT need (like extensions wires and extra screws).  I also really appreciated how everything was in separate baggies for which part of the install you were doing and was very well labeled (extras were labeled as extras, pro kit wires in one bag, doorbell wires and screws in another).  I was unable to fit the power kit inside my chime housing but it doesn’t look bad attached to the wall just outside the chime housing (see picture).  It’s just a bit larger than a matchbox.<br><br>Installing the actual ring was even easier.  I was able to drill into grout lines between stones so I had that going for me.  The hook up was super easy, two wires from the house connect to the two connectors on the Ring – doesn’t even matter which is which.  Nice and easy. I will have to work out something to cover the shimmed side, but I’ll work something out.<br><br>Set up was easy and step-by-step.  I was concerned when it was downloading the new firmware and updates and then rebooted because the light was off for (what felt like) a long time (maybe 5 minutes).  But it all went flawlessly.<br><br>3)  Operational Use.  I like being able to set up polygons for the motion detection zones.  I was able to easily mark my drive way, flowerbeds and porch.  I’ve never had a problem with the busy traffic from the road (something the security guy mentioned was a problem with his original Ring).  There are two problems they need to work out:  You will get a motion detect when the night vision clicks on in the evening and when it clicks off in the morning.  Expect that.<br><br>Also, this is not a miracle product.  It will only work as well as your internet connection.  That means a little lag if you’re on a cable connection at peak times.  There are a few times I’ve had the video come up in laggy and weirdly pixilated forms that took a second to work out.  I’ve also noticed our voice connection is VERY quiet.  As in, the person at the door can barely hear the person on the phone, so I consider that feature a bit useless.  We managed to scare our cat sitter from the other side of the country and greet my mom, but I wouldn’t rely on it for communicating with people often.  We managed to talk to our lawn service but we had to yell into the phone and they had to ask us to repeat ourselves a few times.  Also we live on such a busy road that there is a lot of noise which makes the video sound very choppy. So again, I just consider this feature a novelty and not something to rely on.<br><br>I mentioned a cat sitter.  It was kind of awesome to be able to see that she came by every day.  In fact, the first day she didn’t come by until 11:00pm and I worriedly texted her to see if she was going to come.  Every other day I took solace in knowing that she had already stopped by without having to text her or fear her shed forget.  I was able to see when the lawn service came by and did their thing.  I was able to see when packages were delivered and when my mom brought the nephews up to use the pool.  I also got to scare the crap out of our friend as they were leaving our empty house and I wished them goodnight.  That was worth some money right there.  I even caught a few people using my driveway to turn around.<br><br>My favorite bit was the unexpected bonus video of my husband going outside to inspect my work.  I’m keeping that one.<br><br>It catches us leaving for work every day and coming home.  It catches me when I go to fill the bird feeders.  I’ve not had it miss any movement that I’m aware of.  If you have motion sensors on, expect more notifications than you think you will get.  As said, you’ll get the two from nightfall and sunrise.  Plus I get two from me departing for work and my husband departing plus 2 more for each of us coming home.  Add on more for checking the mail and anything you may do in the yard.  This is where not being limited on storage size is handy.  The cloud storage is $30 per year and it keeps videos for 6 months.  It doesn’t say anything about size so having these extra videos doesn’t bother me.  I find the video quality to be great and I can easily identify who is at the door night and day.<br><br>I also like that it came with a decal showing that the house is monitored.  I placed this prominently in my front window along with our security monitoring service decal.  Avoiding bad guys is worth more than catching them.<br><br>I feel like this was a great purchase.  The price is excellent.  I love being able to access it anytime from my phone.  I love knowing what is going on at my house even when I’m on vacation.  I love the security aspect both in surveillance and as a deterrent.  It looks sharp (see photo).  It’s also a lot of fun.  I’ve shown it off to many friends and coworkers, at least one of which decided to get one themselves.<br><br>4) Summary.  CONS: Only as good as your internet connection.  Sunrise and sunset motion detects.  Sound quality is useless in my experience.  PROS:  Access from anywhere, anytime.  Surveillance and deterrent.  Motion zones let you cut out areas you don’t care to monitor (neighbors yard, roads, ect).  Great price.<br><br>As a camera only, I would give this 5+ stars, easy.  I deducted 1 star because they heavily play up the speaker aspect and that seems worthless in my experience with it.  I’m insanely happy with the purchase over all.  In the future I will probably buy a chime and a stick-up cam to go along with it.<br><br>UPDATE:  1 Year-On.  We have had the Ring Pro for One full year now.  I've also added two of the chime accessories.  I'm just as happy with it now as I was when I wrote this review.  We tried to trouble shoot the sound a few times and still have had no luck with it.  I think my unit might just be defective in that area.  However I still think if this was advertised as a camera only, it would be 100% worth the price and 5 stars.  I did have someone point out the sticker over the ring might be the cause of our sound problem, removing it didn't help.<br><br>Our indoor chime had the oddity of only ringing the first chime (rather than a series) after installation.  As our indoor chime was never loud enough anyway, we added two of the chime plug in accessories without even trying to trouble shoot.  We added one chime downstairs and one in our master bedroom.  We've been super happy with them as well.<br><br>UPDATE: 3.5 years later.  Still working. It stopped working for a while so I called customer service before I purchased a new one to make sure it wasn’t some power issue.  They sent me (for free) the version 2.0 power kit and the chime bypass kit.  Turned out the chime bypass kit fixed it.  I didn’t need the indoor mechanical chime anyway as I have two Ring Chime devices.  I used it this morning to tell the pest control guy the gate code without getting out of bed.  It’s been up 4 summers now.<br><br>I still look at it every week to see what animals were creeping in my yard at night.  Love the raccoons that come hang out on my porch some nights.<br><br>If this thing died tomorrow, I’d replace it with the exact same model, no regrets.

  I had high hopes for this products and company. Friends recommended it and didn't have any issue. Well the disappointment came. Power to the unit was good, connection was good and tested on 2 separate routers. Issues have been can't connect to doorbell for live feed, grainy video and shadowing when it occasionally worked. When attempting to view events it was a black screen, also, when there was a even that would be viewable it was just a still image with sound playing in the background. I trusted that their tech support could get it working. Had their level 2 tech support change settijngs around in the router, connect to 2.4 or 5gz channels with both routers. The issues continued. They sent a free chime pro, which is their wireless extender to see if it would help. It actually made the connection worse and the router is 1 foot from the doorbell. The previously sent a replacement ring pro which didn't help either. They have apparently have software problems that are not addressed. It should not be this difficult to get a product to work to get a little protection. Products will be returned.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Will not trigger internal chime when hot.,137 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2018","<span>
  I've had this installed for a few weeks now.  My main reason for writing the review is to save some people the frustration of trying to figure out why the ring will not trigger your internal chime.  This is easy to install if you have an existing wired door bell.  It is easy to set up.  The video quality is good if you have a very strong wifi connection but even then can still be choppy at times when on live view and the two way audio lags and can be choppy.  Overall though it work well though.  My main issue was the the ring was intermittently triggering the internal chime.  I couldn't figure out why.  I reinstalled it twice and reset it a few times.  It was driving me crazy.  It would ring at night but not during the afternoon.  My doorbell gets blazing sun in the afternoon.  Turns out that there is some sort of safety mechanism that shuts down the internal chime when it gets to hot.  I wish I would have known this before I spent an extra hour or two trouble shooting it.  I can't imagine that my door is the only one that gets sun.  If this is a large issue the doorbell should ship with the plug in chime.

  This is one of my first reviews of a product and if I would have written this back when I got the device I would have give this 5 stars.  The quality, cloud support, customer service was top notch.  After July the video quality has gone downhill FAST.  Prior to all the firm ware updates I could make out people walking on my street at night as well as any of the critters running around my property.  After this, the video quality looks like I am playing a game of mine craft in the snow.  The picture is washed out, grainy, and choppy.  I am so dissapointed with the service.  I called/email customer service plenty of times.  Only to have been told it was my power pack, transformer, I needed a chime pro, and my internet reception wasn't that good, etc.  I replaced everything aside from disabling the actual doorbell which I am not going to do.  I was told my doorbell is not getting enough power when the device health says very good and I am getting a continuous 4100mV to the doorbell running on a brand new 24v transformer.  Also told I didn't have good WiFi signal at my door when my router is about 3 feet away from it and I am getting 200mb down/10mb up.  Finally customer service told me it was my Ring Doorbell that was faulty.  This is not the case b/c the doorbell they sent me was on firmware 1.3.7 which is about 8 firmwares old.  The video is amazing and the quality is how I remember it.  If there was a way I can never update my firmware I would be eager to learn if I could do that.  I have been saving screenshots from my old doorbell and the new one so i can use them as proof when the same thing happens.  The video from 2 weeks ago was 8megs and the one I took today was 24meg with only 5 seconds difference in time.  This pretty much confirmed my suspicions that Ring has been reducing the bitrate over each firmware.  So buyer beware as the commercials you see are in NO way close to what you get.  So dissapointed in this product as it was amazing 3 months ago and promoting it to everyone i came in contact with.  Now, not so much as I have taken to showing the drop in quality.  Fix the bitrate and I will change my review aside from that all this device is good for is alerting you when motion is detected and letting you know when someone rings the doorbell while you are away.

  This would be my FOURTH Ring camera. I have three others around my house. but this was my first PRO one.<br>I was replacing my original Ring doorbell with this one, in the SAME spot with the SAME wires. This was has worked flawlessly for two year, but I wanted the better resolution that they Pro has.<br>Set up was easy like my other three. But note you need to install a kit INTO your Doorbell Chime box (see image), but don't worry that only takes a few minutes. NOW load the app to set up the WiFi, click the button on the side and NOTHING, no RING-### anything in my Wifi list. Remember this is my FOURTH Ring camera, The other three installed in minutes. I tried again, nothing in my Wifi list, then I tried an ipad, then a different iPhone, still not showing up in the WiFi list. Then I did a hard restart (hold the side button for over 15 secs) still nothing. I reboot my Router (ASUS), the same router that the other three work great with. Still Nothing. After searching Internet for ideas, I call Tech Support. The asked me to try pretty much everything I already did. After an hour, support said to return the Pro Ring and said its either BAD or not compatible with my doorbell chimes (Well my other Ring worked perfect with it).

  Wow...where do I begin?<br>This is a good product that has the potential to be GREAT!<br>I will say that this is the 2nd one I purchased as I had to return the 1st one. (The 1st one was purchased on Amazon through E Zone Electronics and they have been great to work with!)<br><br>So, 1st off let me say this.  I believe the reason the 1st one didn't work was because of a setting on my Netgear C7000 modem/router.  It's called BeamForming - BFE and BFR.  Once I turned that off, the 2nd Ring Pro connected almost flawlessly.  So keep that in mind.<br><br>So I don't really have anything additional to say about this as the other reviewers have done a great job of that.  It's a good product, professionally packaged (reminded me of how Apple packs things).  It included a very usable screw driver and drill bit (used for drilling into cement or brick).<br><br>Instructions were GREAT! and overall the experience (the 2nd one) was great!<br><br>So, do your homework 1st before ordering:<br>1: MEASURE the voltage AT the doorbell.  Just loosen the screws on your doorbell, put a voltage meter on it (set for AC) and you NEED to have 16v to 24v.  If you don't have it...replace your transformer. (I did.)<br><br>2: MEASURE the wifi signal strength at the doorbell.  Take your phone, download any of the free wifi SPEEDTEST tools (I use Ookla) and make sure you have good signal strength. How much?  According to Ring only 2 MBs up and down.  I have 65 Megs right at the doorbell and the video quality is excellent but the audio is poor.  Very quiet and choppy.<br><br>3: I'm having an issue which I'm hoping is just a setting, but when you push the button to ring the doorbell, it only rings on our phone and doesn't actually ring the old doorbell. (See pic)<br><br>So in a nutshell there you have it.  Is it worth $200?  Welllll....yeah, for now, it's okay. Hopefully soon it'll start to go down as I would love to purchase one for my daughter's house.<br><br>PS: I included a picture of the camera right after I installed it.  Also I included one of my OLD door bell (Buzzer actually)

  I bought this because I thought it was cool. It surprised me just how Awesome the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is!!! I had no prior experience with Ring doorbells or Video doorbells in general. This changed my world. Like a doorbell on steroids. Amazing just how much you can actually see from a camera about the size of a pencil eraser. And you don't just see you can have a conversation with whomever is at your door while you're anywhere. I was so impressed I bought another Ring doorbell about a week after installing and using this one. It is the talking point for everyone who comes to see our new home. I have been recommending to family and friends and talking about Ring in just about every conversation. My parents bought one based on my experience. I was nit picky giving 4 instead of 5 Stars and here is why. You need a very good WiFi signal for Ring to work as advertised. With less than excellent WiFi you might experience what some of the other reviewers complain about, lag. That is lag time from when someone presses your doorbell to when the alert comes up on the Ring App on your device. So if you have this issue and it persists check out your WiFi signal before bashing Ring. My new house has excellent WiFi signal and I have had zero issues now that our network is up and running. As Ring continues to update there software and App hopefully this will help alleviate lag as well. So use to view, talk, save to cloud, security, etc. I highly recommend for anyone. AWESOME!!!

  I was hesitant to buy the Ring Video Doorbell Pro for two reasons: 1) the price is rather steep; and 2) the negative reviews were concerning. But, I am intrigued by the products and needed a security solution so I decided to try a Ring Video Cam first. I fell in love with the cams and ended up buying 3 to put around my property. All work flawless. So I decided I would then take the plunge and buy the Ring Doorbell Pro. I purchased it on March 3.<br><br>Installation - was pretty straight forward. If you've changed a light switch or done simple electrical work then the install shouldn't be an issue. Directions were straight forward and comprehensive enough.<br><br>Performance - from March 3 to March 6 the doorbell worked great. Good wifi, good voltage. Motion detection was awesome. If someone rang my doorbell I got the notification and could view the live video. Then on the afternoon of March 6 I got a notification that the doorbell had lost connectivity. And it has been a bumpy ride ever since.<br><br>Customer Service - I started exchanging emails with customer service. Apparently, all the issues I was experiencing had nothing to do with their perfect product, but everything to do with my lousy house.  It must be bad wiring or it must be bad wifi or it must be bad voltage transformer, etc... Even if you look at their support website, any issue you try to troubleshoot pretty much puts the blame on something in your house. For 4 weeks now I've had off and on exchanges with them and they offer zero real support and have yet to admit I may possibly have a defective device.<br><br>Today, April 5, I now have a $249 doorbell.  I cannot view any video. I do not receive any notifications when someone rings my doorbell. Yet, the doorbell reports perfect health - very good wifi connection, very good voltage readings. The doorbell works like a $3 doorbell from Home Depot - press the button and ding-dong and that is it.  I am trying to get it replaced with Ring, but to this day they still say ""perform a wifi test"" or some ridiculous thing like that.  I keep reminding them I have 3 other Ring cams around my property that all are on that same wifi and all work perfect.<br><br>This doorbell is a ding-dong for sure! Save your money for now until they develop a doorbell that actually works like it is supposed to.

  I purchased this with the thought that since it is wired to your existing doorbell, it did not require a battery.  After the 1 year warranty expired, my doorbell died.  After researching how to fix it, I found that there is indeed a battery inside the unit and once the battery dies, your video doorbell is useless.  There is no repairing this unless you ""mod"" the Ring.  I tried the mod and my Ring must be completely dead.  I am an electronic technician so I have enough experience with soldering components.  I'm very unhappy with this product and so are a lot of other people that this product has failed on them.  Do a search and look up Ring video doorbell pro died.  It seems to be right around a year to 18 months until it fails.  I can't see paying $249 every year for this.  I'll wait until they figure out how to remove the battery from the circuit.<br><br>Update: 12/12/2018  A Ring representative saw my review and reached out to me.  They are sending me a new doorbell to replace the defective one.  Although I am happy they are sending me a new doorbell, I seriously hope they have figured a way to keep this doorbell working for longer than 16 months.

  I have had problems with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro from day 1 ... it's now day 35 and counting.  Video often froze, sometimes nothing more than a black screen ... so rendered the unit pretty much useless.  Tech support was fairly responsive but seemed to go through a generic troubleshooting list when giving me things to check.  The doorbell was always less than 15 feet from my router.  WiFi signal strength and speed was well above what was required.  At Ring support's suggestion I switched from 5GHz to 2.4GHz, reset the unit several times, added a Ring Chime Pro wifi extender (they provided) but if anything the problems seem to have gotten worse.  I've been asking if it could be a defective unit ... yesterday Ring support concluded it may in fact be defective and is sending a replacement.  I will update this review depending on what happens after I replace my current one.<br>Too bad as I have otherwise had good experience with Stick Up Cam, Solar Panel and two Chimes that I installed around same time frame.

  Where to start? I'm fairly tech Savvy so I'm approaching this with that mindset. I have cable internet with 30mb down and 5mb up with a Wi-Fi router 3 feet from the Ring Pro unit. Wires at the doorbell are putting out right at the low end of the recommended range of 16V using a mechanical chime. It's been a LOOONG process of getting this Ring pro to work to the point of ""OK"". The first one gave me hell trying to set it up. It made my mechanical chime go nuts. Their help desk suggested getting a digital chime which I did for $50....didn't help. Returned the digital chime and put my mechanical back up. THEN the ring pro wouldn't connect to my Wi-Fi. Of course, like all companies, their help desk had me go through a script or things to try (reboot router, turn off router, connect ring and turn on router, etc.) they FINALLY referred me to ""2nd level tech support"" on a Sunday. I had been trying to get it to work for four days and had been on with their tech support for all of them. Well, I received an email asking me to make an appointment for 2nd level support which was on a Sunday, a week after first trying to set this thing up . Well on Sunday at the appointed 11AM time, they call right on time. I explained to him ALL of the steps I had taken to try and get the Ring Pro to connect to my Wi-Fi and the other issues. He said, ""You seem to know what your doing, we'll send you another unit"" (good experience with 2nd level tech). Well, five days later, I had my 2nd unit and it connected immediately. They sent a return package with a return shipping label (good customer service on this count). Once the new one was connected, the issue of the jumpy mechanical chime went away as well. I tested a few things and everything seemed go to go.....almost. The motion detection was working, the SMS alerts were working, and the SMS for an actual ring of the door bell was working. What wasn't working was my mechanical door bell. Another call to tech support and this time I REQUESTED 2nd level support immediately which surprisingly, they agreed. The next day I received a phone call from the same 2nd level tech guy. Again, he said, I trust that you know what your doing so I'm going to send you one of our Ring chimes (another Wi-Fi gadget that plugs into a wall outlet that takes the place of your mechanical chime). Well in five days, I had it. Set up was easy and it worked well. Now I had all the functions I needed; a functioning doorbell, functioning security cam with motion detection, functioning SMS alerts, and set up on four family phones so everyone gets the alerts...I was finally after four weeks satisfied.....so I thought..""sigh"".<br>Fast forward a week after my initial satisfaction with everything finally working. One night, all of us started receiving motion alerts every 5 to 10 minutes after nightfall. After reviewing the recordings, it became evident what was happening was the night vision was turning on an off repeatedly and the noise from the loud ""Click"" of them turning on was causing a motion activation with the associated SMS alert. So the first night I turned off the motion alerts so we could sleep and turned them back on during daylight hours. This went on for three days. Since I knew the problem was with the night vision/IR LED's. I tried a work around which worked. Since the Ring is on my front porch right fairly close to my porch light, I tried turning on my porch light ""tricking"" the sensors into thinking it's daylight negating the need for the IR LED's to turn on. At first it didn't work but my light was an old incan yellow-ish light. so I put one of my daylight 60W LED bulbs in it an bam, worked like a charm. To further this and to prevent me from having to remember to turn on the porch light every night, I went another step. I went out and bought the Phillips HUE system and one of their 60W connected LED bulbs. I put their bulb in the porch light and tested it. It worked well for this application. Finally, I downloaded the IFTTT app and created a recipe for the HUE front porch light - ""IF sunset THEN turn on HUE front porch light"" and of course the reverse, ""IF sunrise THEN turn off HUE front porch light"". Now everything is automated and seems to be working good with no false night vision alerts. The only drawback to this idea was that the vision from the Ring Pro is limited to the area lit by the LED porch bulb which is significantly less than that of the night vision provided by the ring. Of course it also requires me to leave the front porch light on all night.<br>Further email exchanges with the Ring 2nd level tech support guy has revealed that that the night vision switching on and off is a known issue and should be remedied with a future firmware upgrade. My other complaint is the black screen I get when I respond to a motion detection about 20% of the time. Even some motion detections that I don't answer are nothing but 30 seconds of black screen with no sound. Hopefully this can be remedied with a firmware as well.<br><br>App. Recommendations:<br>1.) Would like to be able to select my desired video resolution (it's currently auto).<br>2.) Would like to be able to view recordings as they happen when clicking on an event and not wait until the full 30 seconds is recorded and processed.<br>3.) Allow some setting edits on the actual website<br>4.)  Integrate with ""works with Nest"" so that a pre-selected nestcamera can activate when motion or the door bell is rung. UPDATE: I figured out a workaround now with IFTTT so that this can be achieved.<br>5.) Allow users to select custom alerts for the doorbell and motion alerts.<br><br>CONCLUSION: It is my belief that the hardware of the Ring Pro is solid. Their problem lies in their software which assuming they have talented IT guys should be able to remedy. I think where Ring went wrong was rushing their product to market too quickly without sufficient time for BETA testers which is basically what we as consumers are at this point. Consumers who spend $249 for the most part DO NOT want to be BETA testers (as displayed by all the negative Amazon reviews). I believe with sufficient time, Ring can work out the bugs and have a rock solid product. Their downfall unfortunately may be however a flood of negative reviews causing business failure resulting in a dead in the water product for those that bought it. I hope they see the writing on the wall and put a team of very angry and determined software guys on this to save their reputation and company. Anything short of this, I fear this product will fail.<br><br>UPDATE 6/8/2016: I received an email from 2nd level support advising me that a new firmware update (1.1.30) had just rolled out to address the IR lights turning on and off repeatedly causing multiple motion alerts. Well, it did keep them from turning on and off repeatedly but the problem is now they don't turn on at all!....come on ring..So currently, I have no night vision/IR lights so I'm still relying on my porch light to supplement the Ring Pro to see anything at night.<br><br>Update 6/16/16: Well right after I wrote the last update on 6/8, I also emailed ring to tell them about the night vision issue. While waiting for a return email, on 6/10, the night vision started working again. Also on 6/10, I received another email from ring saying that mine sounds like it needed replacing again and that a new one was on it's way. I immediately emailed them and told them NOT to send it because this one had started working again. I received a reply saying, ""Great, let us know if you have any further problems."" Chalk one up for good customer service on Ring's part. Well, today 6/16 when I arrived home, there it is, a replacement ring pro. I guess I'll be honest and send it back after I keep it a few days to make sure the one I have doesn't goo chichi's paribba in the short term :)  All things considered, as much of a pain this process has been, THUS far Ring customer service has been pretty good; albeit a bit slow at times. More updates to come!?!??!....maybe.<br><br>UPDATE: 7/27/2016: Well things have gone better for the last month. It seems Ring has worked out many of the bugs. My brother, neighbor and friend who also have the Ring Pro report the same thing. MOST of the bugs seemed to have been remedied. The bugs that seem to remain (which a potential buyer should be aware of) is<br>1.) the issue of some old doorbell not working properly. Like I stated above, ring sent me one of their ring Wi-Fi doorbells as a remedy and that works good for me.<br>2.) You'll need a good/fast Wi-Fi connection for video uploads. Mine ranges around 5mbs up and that works good. My neighbor uses ATT u-verse with a blazing fast upload speed of 0.5mbs up and all he gets are bad still shots. My brother uses another cable co. and gets 2.5mbs up and it works fine.<br>3.) There are still occasionally ""black screen"" issues when responding to motion or doorbell rings. In other words when you receive a motion detection or ring notification on your cell and you click to view, you see nothing but a black screen; no picture, no sound. It can usually be remedied by going out of the application and trying again. This presents a problem because of the time that elapses from the motion or ring until you can see whats going on. What I usually see are people walking away or nothing at all because they have left. While this is irritating, it happens about 5% of the time which I find acceptable for the piece of mind you get for the watchful eye at the door.<br>4.) You still cannot view a 30 second recording until the Ring server has finished processing it if you miss the 30 second motion activation or Ring notification record window. If you do miss it, you'll have to wait for about 30 seconds to view the activity. I hope this process gets faster or is illuminated completely.<br><br>9/6/2016: Last week I came home and the Ring Doorbell Pro was completely dead. I don't know if it was a power surge or what had happened. A quick call to Ring's customer service and about a 10 minute dance through the script that they have to go through and I had another Ring on the way. It took 6 days to get there but it took about 5 minutes to remove the old ring and set up the new one. Ring was even nice enough to give me an extra 3 months of cloud service for my troubles. Ring still scores highly on customer service in my book.<br><br>2-2017 - Well everything worked great for a while. For the past two months there is no longer two way communication available via any of my phones. The alerts are still good (motion and rings) but if you try to have a conversation with anyone, the video locks up. I've tried calling Ring to troubleshoot the issue but thus far no solutions have been provided. I've even upgraded my internet speed to 100mps down / 12mps up. This being said I still feel the ring is worth it due to the extra security it provides. I wish they could remedy the video locking issue. My nest cam that I have indoors has had zero issues for over 1.5 running; two way conversations and all.<br><br>CONCLUSION: So the question in most minds is, ""So should I get one?"" If you have a good/fast internet connection and you like the idea of a watchful eye at your door, then at this point I would recommend the Ring Pro. I'm still not convinced that I'm getting 1080P quality out of the videos. Since Ring doesn't allow users (at this time) to select their video quality, it's up to the software to select based upon internet speed/bandwidth. This is fine but I'd like to be able to select it myself. One other improvement that MAY help would be the incorporation of something allowing higher dynamic range in their videos like HDR  or something of that nature. If your ring is in a shaded area like mine is and facing out to a brightly lit street the camera/software has to decide which to meter to get the correct exposure. If it meters under my porch, then the street is completely white washed/blown out, if it meters the street, the area under the porch is too dark. This is NOT an issue unique to the Ring Pro. All camera's have this issue and photographer struggle with the problem all the time. It is over come by either using a neutral density filter or using a software solution like HDR. I don't know how ring would incorporate a neutral density filter but some type of HDR solution might suffice. All this being said,  their customer service has been good for me albeit a little slow at times. They do follow-up to insure their product is satisfactory. The hardware seems well built, the software has most of the bugs fixed and I think the Ring Pro is finally ready finally for prime time. The same is being reported by at least six users I know. They all agree, that they like the product now. I'm happy with mine and will be keeping it and the people that I know that have them are keeping theirs. Lets hope the improvements continue.

  Worked fine in the beginning. Since then I'm on my 3rd unit. I had it professionally installed by HelloTech. Now they're asking me about diodes and transformers and want me to get on a ladder to check details for the original installation. When they're selling it to you they don't mention the complexity.  So far I've paid for the Pro Unit, a Chime Unit, HelloTech installation, and months of Cloud Storage for a system that is down again with no future in sight short of hiring an electrician with no guarantee he can make it work. Its been a multi hundred dollar waste of time and money.

  The ring pro was very fun while it lasted. It was a little laggy most of the time, but overall worked as advertised. The phone app and cloud service are decent. Less than two months past the one year mark (warranty period...) it just died. We reset it by disconnecting power for a while and it came back up, until you pressed the button, then it died again. I called tech support and they said it was out of warranty and we'd have to purchase a new doorbell, that it was a ""known issue"". Tech support actually said ""known issue"" for the doorbells dying like this! I asked her if I was supposed to buy another $250 because of a known issue and she said yes! It's been over a month since I sent my last email to tech support and nothing. I'd call again, but at this time, why bother, by them ignoring my inquiries I figure they feel they have gotten my money so they will just ask for more or be content with me not pestering them. So... they are pretty much out of a customer. You can get the protection plan for $100/year, but either it wasn't around or I wasn't told about that plan when I made my purchase. If you are paying the $30 for cloud service, what's another $70 for the year? If they had offered some kind of discount for the new doorbell, or retro'd the protection plan that would have been great, but I'm not buying another $250 doorbell after 14 months and slapping another $100 on top of that. If you get the doorbell, get the protection plan and you should be happy. We had some good laughs with this product, but support has left me wanting.<br><br>*************UPDATE************************<br>After several rounds with Ring, they did replace the doorbell and also recommended that I transformer be replaced. I finally go a hold of someone in support who knew their stuff and told me the transformer was probably the reason it went out in the first place, because of insufficient power, being used during an update, or some doomsday scenario (for the doorbell). So....  &lt; $20 for a transformer and new doorbell later, we are back in business. I purchased the protection plan so the doorbell is now covered and I'm happy. It was just a pain in the butt to get ring to the point of replacing the doorbell, but thank you, Ring.

  It worked well for about 2 weeks then the inside doorbell chime didn't ring when someone pushed the Ring button.  After talking with the Ring support, I ended up buying and installing a new doorbell chime and transformer because I couldn't find a model number on the one I had, that made the Ring people say that I probably didn't have a ""compatible"" doorbell chime.  After installing the new doorbell chime and transformer (in the attic), it did the same thing.  I have been back and forth with them for weeks now when it is obvious that the Ring unit is defective.  I just received an email from Ring support that now they want a photo of the doorbell chime wiring, a photo of the transformer in the attic and want me to take the Ring unit out of the wall and get a photo of the wiring going to it.  Good luck if you have a problem and need to get a replacement unit....it was an expensive lesson, I paid $249 for the unit through Amazon.

   I heard so many people in my neighborhood talking about the Ring Doorbell; after I saw the video images and sound, I was sold. Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING (well, except the drill) you need to install &amp; set up your Ring is included in the box. I was worried about needing someone with electrical skills to help me get it done, but the directions are so clear and easy to follow, you will amaze yourself at how easy it is to set it up. It works perfectly. The only time it did not work was when I had to reboot my modem, but my regular doorbell rang without missing a beat. I no longer want to be without my Ring and have purchased the Ring Floodlights to secure the rest of my home. The best part? Me being 20 miles across town, my phone alerting me to motion at my door and being able to SEE who was there and TALK to that person - they had no idea I was not at home. My daughters have the app and access to their phones also so we are all connected and watchful. What an awesome invention!!

  Let me say first I am a fan of Ring. I previously purchased/installed the video doorbell and a stickup cam with the solar charger. They work great so I was excited to read about a doorbell that was powered off of the already-installed doorbell.  Not so fast.  If you have a newer home (ours was built 5 years ago) with only one doorbell at the front door, the chances are, this product won't work.  You'll first need to locate and probably replace the transformer. Unless you have several doorbells working off the same transformer, most homes will have a 16 volt, 10 volt-amp transformer.  That's not nearly enough power. Add $15 for a Home Depot 24 volt 20 volt-amp transformer.  Whoops, that burned out the 16 volt chime I had.  Add another $25 (and 100 miles in my case) to get a 16 volt 30 volt-amp transformer. Buy a new doorbell chime (make sure it's on the list of compatible chimes -- they don't tell you that up front either.  Oh, and I hope you don't have more than a 15 foot run from your  transformer to the doorbell or the voltage drop in two-conductor bell wire will not power the video doorbell pro.  In my case the 30 foot run stopped me dead in my tracks. I read on some forums that the best thing you can do is run separate power to the video doorbell, then add the Ring wireless doorbell chime/range extender (another $50.)  I spent a full day, more than 150 miles, lots of forum searches and a call to tech support to find out I should not have wasted my time and money. Returned it.

  Video quality really isn't very good. I made sure to give it a dedicated wifi access point very close to the door on a good router.  My internet speed is consistently 100 Mbps with 10 Mbps upload.  The ""live view"" video quality is just bad.  I'm probably going to switch this out for the Nest Doorbell when that comes out.<br><br>There is a very noticeable delay between the time from when the button is pressed and the time when you get the alerts or the Chime product that you have to pay extra for rings.  Video often takes a while to get started, too.  The delay is well over 5 - 10 seconds usually and if you live in a major city that is already more time than any courier will stay at your door.<br><br>The software is really pretty bad, too.  You can't easily do things like changing wifi settings without going through the entire setup process which requires you to take off the cover.  I should be able to change settings on the thing via the app, but you can't.<br><br>They claim it's 1080p video and while that may technically be true due to lines of resolution, whatever they use to encode the video makes it look really bad. At best it looks like 480p video at a low bitrate.  It's really bad.<br><br>Reducing my review to 1 star:  This thing doesn't even seem to work half the time.<br><br>Update: I'm increasing my review to 2 stars because the company really tried to reach out and help me with my issues, but unfortunately the software is just really buggy and doesn't offer nearly enough configuration options that it should and the video quality isn't good enough for me.  I think I just have higher expectations.<br><br>Update: I'm reducing my review back to 1 stars, because after about a year of use this thing barely works whenever I need.  I'm certain I have a strong WIFI connection even as reported by the unit's health checks itself.  Video quality remains terrible and spotty.  The app doesn't respond quickly enough to actually answer in time.  The thing doesn't work reliably.  I don't know if they break things between firmware releases or something like that because I do get times where it's ok, but it isn't reliable at all.  It does look a lot nicer than the Nest so I'm not switching it out yet, but I do need something that works and this thing doesn't work reliably.

  Nest cams, including their doorbell offer a DVR styled recording with flagged motion events. Which is awesome. With this Ring doorbell it failed to sense motion in the zones I had set up during a middle of the night encounter I had with an SUV full of ppl trying to break into mine and my neighbor's vehicles. Also, their motion alerts on phone and Apple Watch do not show the event that triggered the motion. You have to wait until its done with it's 1-2min recording, then wait for it to upload to their cloud, THEN and only then can you see what triggered the motion. As a man who works with a wife and children at home, that is alot of time from when a bad event starts to when I could be alerted that something bad is going on. Especially when that is one of the only reasons I bought the doorbell in the first place.<br><br>The NEST hello shows a thumbnail of what triggered the motion on my Apple Watch, and repeating GIF on the banner on my cell phone lock screen of the motion event that triggered the notification.<br><br>All of those negatives aside, the customer service is absolutely SPECTACULAR. So if you are fine with a far inferior product for the couple bucks a month savings, there's that. And all those negatives btw, can probably be changed with software and server upgrades. So if Ring gets their sh** together and upgrades some better features this might actually compete with the NEST products. Right now however, its a no brainer for anyone who wants a fully functional camera doorbell. Take it from a guy who bought a Nest Hello, not on sale and have my $200 ring doorbell sitting on a shelf in my garage now. I’m saying all of this from first hand experience.

  I have had my Doorbell Pro for just over a couple of years and I recently started having issues with it. About once a week or more depending on how many visitors I get, the Ring Doorbell Pro will lose wireless connection. The only way I can get it to come back on is by resetting the breaker for the circuit it is on. When I contacted their support they were utterly useless. They walked me through very basic troubleshooting steps, ignored my own troubleshooting and told me my unit no longer functioned, that they could not replace it as it is out of warranty and that I should buy a new one and pay $10 a month for a warranty plan. Unlike others who have been offered some sort of discount (some 10$ off, others 100$ off) I was given no such offer.<br><br>The issue with my device, as I and many many others have come to find out is that the Ring Doorbell pro uses a small battery that acts much like a capacitor to help supply enough power to trigger the mechanical chime of your door bell as well as initialize the live video. Ring claims there is no battery and no need to charge this device, and that is only a half truth. There is indeed a battery, which does require for it to hold a charge, unfortunately the battery only lasts about one to two years and is not a serviceable part. At least not according to Ring, you need the whole device to be replaced. This replacement is only performed under warranty, and the refurbished (not new) replacement unit has a limited warranty. If your Ring dies after your 1 year warranty, you are completely out of luck.<br><br>Some of the pictures I have seen of the dead or none functional battery show it puffed out, which is very dangerous. This shows that there is a serious lack of safety engineering put into battery protection for this device. This appears to be a serious defect that they refuse to acknowledge. I recommend that you avoid purchasing any Ring brand products. Unless you like throwing away money.<br><br>Edit: Ring seems to have made a real effort in fixing a lot of their support issues and replacing their first and second gen releases to be more stable and reliable. I've upgraded my review to three stars for now because I want to continue to make sure that their product quality control has changed. The Ring support team reached out to me and offered me a replacement which has been fully functional and working for the past three months. The newer generation of the Ring pro seems to be much more reliable.

  This product has so much potential, but it simply DOES NOT WORK as advertised. Video?! More like still pictures. I have a great internet connection AND I even purchased a Chime Pro Wi-Fi- to try and help. No luck. Every time I answer a motion or watch a video it shows about 3 seconds then freezes. And stays frozen. If you're lucky it will skip ahead to another still shot. I wanted so bad to return the product, but there are certain uses that me and my girlfriend wanted to keep. The motion sensor works great, we always know when somebody is in our yard or walkway. We can get a STILL SHOT of who was at our door. We know when packages get dropped off before the delivery notifications etc. But I would NOT recommend this product for $250. As for the answering the doorbell and talking to your visitor, it is barely functional. It sort of works. Basically when we first got it and set it up we tried and it was wonky and didn't work. We tried a few minutes later and it sort of worked, just a delay which is expected and understandable. The video cuts in and out, but it doesn't outright freeze like the recorded videos. We haven't tried it much since, but i was able to talk to my gf through it on one other occasion without any real issue. Just choppy and laggy. What's weird here is that the live feed, while still laggy and buggy looking, works better than the recorded videos.<br><br>SUMMARY: It has some useful features such as the motion sensor and a slightly serviceable live feed, but overall the product seems like it flat out does not work as it should, or as the price reflects. If you want a motion sensor that will alert you when people are approaching your door, this is great. If you want to be able to see a video of somebody approaching your door and what they do, this is NOT the product for you. If you want to answer your doorbell from anywhere and chat, good luck. The delay means you usually get people as they are walking away, and even if you get them, the video, and to lesser extent the audio, will be very laggy, delayed, and borderline embarrassing to use with visitors.<br><br>P.S. All those Facebook ads I see where the video is working perfectly?? LOL not sure who is lucky enough to have it work that good, but again with a good, fast internet I have had no such luck.

However, after trying to rely on it for a year or so, I've come to realize it's just not happening.<br><br>I started with the basic, then upgraded to the Pro when that wouldn't work.  I've got great bandwidth (85 down/32 up on a bad day), a good connection to the unit, and ""very good"" voltage.  The RSSI (received strength at the unit) is in the moderate range.  I added the Chime Pro to boost the signal.  I've spent more hours on the phone with tech support just to get it to work at all at the beginning than I'd care to count.  Now, when I just ask for a ""Live View,"" about 90% of the time, it just times out and says it can't reach the unit.  Do all the troubleshooting again -- same results.  So basically, I have a VERY expensive doorbell/motion detector.  If you want to be using it with other Amazon/Alexa products, forget about it.  Even on the occasion the image DOES come up, it can take 30 seconds or more to appear, by which time the person at your door is likely gone.<br><br>If you're going to sell a product as a video doorbell, and a massive number of your customers cannot get it to reliably work as a video doorbell, you should let people know ahead of time what to expect.  I wonder how many people like me just give up after a time and never return it or complain about it.  (And yes, I'm long since past my return date.)  But at the price of this unit, I'm sorry, I've gotta complain.  They are fully aware of all these issues, and leaving consumers to deal with it.  Most disappointing.

  I bought this product for my dad for Christmas, and we spent most of the day trying to get it to work. The main problem we encountered, which is mentioned quite a bit in other forums online, is that we could not get the device to power on after wiring it to the existing doorbell wiring. My dad is a pretty techie guy and had a voltmeter on hand, so we were able to easily verify that enough power was routing to the Ring doorbell (17V). Other purchasers online commented that it took up to 24 hours for the device to finally power up connecting the wiring, but the eventual solve for us was discovering that there is a hidden micro USB port on the side of the device. To access it, you need to pry off a little plastic panel to the left of the doorbell button. Using the port, we plugged the device into the wall using an iPad charger, and the doorbell came to life. After letting it sit for a while, we then wired it back into the front door, and it’s worked fine ever since (device health in the app shows “Very Good” voltage).<br><br>I’m giving it 4 stars because once we got it working, all of the features work flawlessly as advertised. But, it was very difficult to get working, and if we weren’t “tech enthusiasts,” probably would have given up much earlier and returned the device. Ring: please include more detailed trouble-shooting information for customers. I’m surprised that it was a commenter on Reddit that eventually clued me into the hidden USB port that solved our problem and not Ring support. (Or better yet, address quality control issues...)

  Save your money and your time and no matter what preserve the packaging and components so you can easily send this back.  Installing the doorbell is simple and only takes about 10 minutes.  Once you begin setup is when you will need 4+ hours to troubleshoot issues through chat and phone calls with Ring. The app only has 3 stars or so in the iOS app store so that'll give you a sense of how great it isn't.  It's plagued with problems during the whole set up. Honestly just get a Nest camera is you can and save yourself the trouble.

  My overall experience with the Ring Pro after about a month has been frustrating to say the least.  I am still hoping to wring as much potential out of the thing, but dealing with customer support after the initial 30 day return policy expires is a little bit disheartening.<br><br>I was initially sold on how the Ring Pro was advertised to work with your existing doorbell wiring and you did not need to purchase anything new.  I had read some reviews that indicated they experienced some trouble getting the Ring Pro to work, but decided to plunge in and see what would happen.  After installing the wiring bypass thingy with the doorbell chime and then installing the Ring Pro at the front door, I could get the white ring to come up and power on, but was unable to get it to broadcast a wi-fi signal.  After some research online, I noted that this usually indicates a power issue and one suggestion was to get the Ring Pro Power Cable that would bypass your doorbell chime altogether and ensure the Pro received enough power.<br><br>Received the cable from Ring free of charge and installed the cable, yet the Ring Pro refused to broadcast a signal still.  Further research suggested replacing the doorbell transformer.  After a trip to the local hardware store and installing a brand new 16v transformer, I still experienced the same issue.  I decided at that point the unit was defective and requested a new one.  I was still within the 30 day refund window and so far had experienced quick and helpful response from Ring.<br><br>Received the new unit and installed it and success!  The Ring Pro powered on and it broadcasted a wi-fi signal.  Initially I connected it to the 5Ghz network of my wi-fi router but the signal was intermittent and had trouble keeping a consistent connection (the distance between the Ring Pro and the router is about 30 feet at most, but has to travel through a brick wall).  So using the 2.4Ghz network, the signal was more consistent, but the quality didn’t seem good, although, the Ring app indicated that I only needed a 1Mbps up and down connection for it to work properly, which I had.  When I say the quality is poor, the video I see is a pixelated mess, including stuttering and lost frames.  So if someone broke into my house through the front door, I would be hard pressed trying to identify whether it was sasquatch, the stay puft marshmallow man or a real human being.<br><br>After complaining to the Ring folks about the quality, I was told that there appeared to be signal interference causing the poor quality.  I was then offered the Ring Pro Chime that might be able to improve the signal between the router and the Ring Pro.  I accepted, which they sent free of charge (a nice touch).  After successfully installing that and connecting it to the Ring Pro, the quality of the video has not improved.<br><br>I contacted customer support again to see what over steps can be taken to improve the quality and I was told to send them a video file so they can analyze and get back to me.  I have yet to receive a response back after a week later and after several follow-ups.  Note that I am now outside of the 30 day return policy and it seems like customer support has gone dark considering I can no longer return the thing.<br>I will update this review as needed/necessary if I manage to get anywhere.<br><br>Update 8-15-17: as others have noted in their reviews here, after posting a bad review, folks from Ring will contact you to see how they can improve your experience.  I was assigned to someone on their ""neighborhood"" team and was able to schedule a call with her to walk through the issues I was experiencing and attempting some troubleshooting steps.  We eventually got on a three way call with L2 support and they further provided steps on how to improve the signal between the router and the chime pro, mainly in putting the Ring on a DMZ in the router settings.  After almost a 2 hour call, the stuttering effect is mostly gone, but the pixelation is still mostly there, but at least I can better identify the person at the door.  I'm afraid to walk through any further troubleshooting steps as I really don't have another 2 hours to waste being on the phone, to maybe get a small bump in quality.  Ultimately I feel like the product should work right out of the box and having to tweak things incessantly to get marginal improvements is more frustrating than anything.  I had considered getting the Ring Floodlight, but after all this trouble, most likely not.  Important note though, after initially getting emails from Ring without any issues, after a month, my spam filter started junking their emails, mostly from the neighborhood specialist.  So if you end up not getting a timely response, check your junk folder.<br><br>Update 2018 - at the beginning of the year, I went the route of cord cutting (got rid of traditional cable TV) and got a streaming service.  As part of that switch, I invested in a much better wifi router as before I was using the Verizon FiOS router which was ok, but the 5ghz band sucked.  After that switch, the ring video quality is much much better and does not stutter and pixelate like it did.  I am not changing my rating however since customer service would not confirm if my Verizon router was the culprit with all my video quality issues (I asked several of the customer support folks the same direct question and each one pointedly ignored it).  Why?  My guess is that they dont want to acknowledge that most folks need a quality router in order to get the best video from the Ring.  Because if they did that, they are saying you not only need to put up big bucks for the Ring, but also for an expensive router, which I think would turn off some folks.

  Don't be fooled by all of their misleading ads about how easy installation is. Sure if your doorbell transformer provides exactly the amount of power Ring Pro requires then it would be easy. But what Ring's tech team taught me (after the fact) is that most transformer (like mine) do not! So odds are, not only will you replace your doorbell, you'll also have to replace your transformer. And if your chime unit doesn't support the upgraded transformer (again odds are it won't, because it was installed with the one you're replacing), you'll have to replace it to.<br><br>What should have taken 30 minutes took me all day, multiple trips to the hardware store, and eventually help from an electrician. And I live in a 4 year old modern home... Not something older that warrants upgrades.<br><br>Here's the problem... Most mechanical doorbells like mine, have 10VA transformers. I followed the installation instructions perfectly. But my Ring Pro wouldnt power on. So I called support, and a Ring Pro tech told me it requires at least 16VA, and my transformer wasn't providing enough power, and I should replace mine with a 30VA ""just to be safe"" (that dumb comment alone made me doubtful). But I followed orders, upgraded the transformer. A neighbor electrician verified that the doorbell was receiving 30 volts. But still Ring Pro wouldn't power on. So I called back, and another Ring Pro tech told me 30 was too much. I explained I got 30 because the first tech said to, and he suddenly changed his opinion, and said the problem was I needed to replace my chime to match 30 as well.<br><br>At this point I had wasted a day and was fed up. I was getting nowhere, and wasn't about to upgrade more components in my house. So I told them to just replace it with the older model (because it requires less power). But they told me they didn't want to replace products purchased from Amazon. I guess after all I went through, that would be too easy.<br><br>Lesson learned... Nothing about this is ""easy"" no matter how many times they print it on the box!

  1.  You must have a VERY STRONG Wifi signal for this video doorbell to work.  My signal wasn't quite strong enough so I upgraded my service to above the required download speed and it still doesn't work all the time.<br>2.  After 30 days you must purchase their ""Cloud Video Recording"" service to be able to see who came to your doorbell if you weren't able to answer the video when it rang.  I couldn't see a live video of who rang my doorbell in the first 30 days, but I was able to see the video that recorded them in the Cloud Video Recording.  Now that the 30 days trial period is up I can't see them live and the recording of the event is not something I can see either now that the free 30 day Cloud Video Recording is expired.<br><br>So this doorbell has become an expensive one and a time consuming headache. I'm a technical guy ... I work on computers and I know how to set this device up.  But it has not been easy at all.  Unless you have an extremely strong Wifi signal and you a good with setting up wireless devices I would NOT purchase this doorbell.  Even if you are you will need to pay their monthly service fee to see who came to the door if you missed picking up the video when they rang it.  I wish I would have never purchased this doorbell.  It's been one issue after another and a costly want.

  This is a great smart home device for being able to see video of your front door and speak to the person at the door - even if you’re hundreds of miles away!<br><br>PROS:<br>* Installation was pretty easy (I used a uniden product before this and couldn’t get it to work with my existing wiring at all ... but see CONS below)<br>* Video App (when someone rings the bell, my phone rings, and I can open the app to see video of the front door and speak to the person at the door if I like)<br>* Detects motion (I’ve seen some complaints on earlier versions that it detects cars passing by, etc.  This one allows you to define the zone for motion control - so I set a zone that included the front yard but not the road.  I hardly ever get false positives, but I rarely miss it when something is moving “in the zone”).<br>* Motion detection can also alert your phone.  So if you’re expecting a package and the delivery person doesn’t ring your bell, you can still be alerted and ask your neighbor to grab it for you.<br>* Captures video (you can set it to capture video whenever motion is detected and whenever the bell is rung ... but see CONS).<br>* Integrates with a ringer device (purchased separately - this device can make a sound whenever motion is detected or the bell rings)<br><br>CONS:<br>* Some installation (particularly for your existing doorbell wiring) is required.  But the instructions are pretty clear, and it went pretty quickly.  I’m moderately handy around the home and was able to handle this solo.<br>* I could not get mine to actually make my existing doorbell ring.  This is an improvement over the Uniden bell I had (which made my existing bell constantly hum).  But I had to purchase the ringer device to get a functioning doorbell.  I’m not sure if I just did the doorbell wiring incorrectly or not - but I suspect that different doorbells are different voltage and the Ring kit wasn’t made for mine.  This is what cost a star in my rating.<br>* Capturing video requires a monthly contract.  Ring would tell you that this is the cost for hosting your data.  But my Blink Video cameras include motion capture, and there is no monthly fee.  Ring could also integrate with OneDrive or Google Drive to capture video to an existing cloud storage area.  There’s just not a good excuse for charging you monthly for this service.  This cost another star.

  This continually disconnected from my strong network and the process to reconnect requires a screwdriver and about ten minutes of standing next to your doorbell. I had to do this every morning. Please note, I have many devices and nothing else disconnects from my network. The device also showed a very good electrical connection.<br><br>I returned the Ring product and replaced it with one from Arlo. That one connects much more easily and it would probably re-connect except that it has never lost connection. With Ring, ""live"" view worked only sometimes and took up to a minute or two. Honestly, I like the concept of the Ring which is why I purchased it. But after spending a ridiculous amount of time trying to get it to work consistently, I gave up. I'm glad I bought it from Amazon where returns are easy.<br><br>The kicker: There is no way to delete your account. You are required to set up an account for the Ring to work but they won't let you get rid of it. Once they've got your email, it's theirs forever. I contacted support and the response was: ""There is no way to completely delete your account.""<br><br>Word of advice: Unless you're sure you want a permanent relationship with Ring, give them an email address you can easily discard. They won't let you change that once you set up your account.

  Initially when I installed my Ring Pro just under a year ago, the service was great. Whenever someone rang the bell I could load the camera and talk to the person at the door. These days however it's impossible. Whenever the bell is rung, the video tries to load but it just sits and tells me it's having issues connecting to Ring. This occurs 100% of the time now and it clears up after a minute or two but after the person has left. When there's nobody at the door, I can load the live video very quickly and without issues. This tells me that that Ring network can't handle the two-way video/audio communication. It grew too fast and without adequate investment in their infrastructure. Hopefully they fix it in the future, but this door bell no longer provides the service that it used to and I cannot recommend it.

  Would be great if it worked reliably - but it didn't.  Doorbell was w/in 20 ft of our router, and had a strong signal - but twice it went ""off-line"" and the help articles had me go and take the cover off to reset it.  This worked - but to happen twice within 2 weeks was way too often.  The app was hit/miss on whether or not it alerted me, which was the deal breaker.  Someone rang the doorbell while we weren't home, and my phone never notified me.  Again - did their troubleshooting and after completely removing and reinstalling the app - it worked . . . a few times.  Wound up returning it before the 30 days because for this kind of money - it needs to work.<br><br>We used Ring's recommended installation service, who did a good job (and explained the very narrow electrical requirements, which we did have to get a new transformer installed just to get it to work the first time).  And when it worked - I liked it.  But we mainly wanted to know when someone dropped off a package (which I could check the app, and it saved me a trip to the front door - not enough of a benefit by itself), or have the ability to answer the doorbell when we weren't home.  I love the idea/concept, but didn't work for us.

  Great concept, mediocre implementation. We've had this installed for about a year, and it's gone from ""okay"" to ""unusable"" in the last few months. Unreliable connections are the worst of it, so much so that I'll be replacing my Ring with a Nest or August doorbell in the next few months and have to eat the high price tag of this useless device.<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Installation. Easy, no problems. I installed the doorbell myself in place of an existing doorbell and chime, and it went smoothly. The instructions were clear and adequate.<br>2. Camera functionality. I really appreciate the wide angle of the camera, which makes it easy to see people approaching the front door from the street, and then if they walk toward the back of my house.<br>3. Effective night vision. I've read that some other doorbells have poor night vision, but this one does a good job of showing a person's features when they approach the door.<br>4. Decent app. The app is pretty intuitive and doesn't require excessive tapping to do simple things like live view, history, and settings. I also like that I can set motion detection zones, since car headlights were triggering motion alerts until I played with the motion zones.<br>5. Easy sharing. No problems sharing the doorbell controls with my husband. You can also set the motion sensitivity by user, which is great since my husband wants alerts for every little thing and I only want alerts for probably people. We can each get the motion and/or ring alerts we want by tweaking our own settings in the app.<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Doesn't integrate with much. The only partner in the app is Wemo, so I can't integrate this doorbell with my Nest, Abode, Hue, etc. And while it works with Alexa, I never use my Alexa for anything other than ordering anymore. I'd far rather this integrated with my Google Home, which is our default Assistant.<br>2. Unreliable app notifications. My husband and I can be sitting next to each other in the same room with the doorbell chime, and hear when someone rings the bell. About half the time, the Ring app on his phone notifies him within 30 seconds (or so) (which is still really slow when you've got someone standing on the porch). But those same times, the app on my phone doesn't notify me until 5-8 minutes AFTER the person pushed the button. Since it's notifying my husband's phone but not mine, it's obviously not a WiFi issue.<br>3. App fails to load properly. Most of the time when I try to interact with the person at the door (those few times it actually notifies me while they're still there), the app hangs up before the camera connects - I get a blank screen instead of the camera live view. If I back out of the app and go back in and tap ""Live View,"" I can then interact with the person. Why it doesn't connect the first time, I have no idea.<br><br>For the record, I've gone through all of the (lousy) Help materials on the Ring site, and checked the Device Health repeatedly. The WiFi tests and Device Health all tell me the doorbell SHOULD be working just fine. Since it's not, the only thing I can assume is it's just not a reliable product. Incredibly disappointed to have spent the money on this device for only a couple months of useful life.

As opposed to trying to install myself due to a busy work schedule, I hired an electrician to do the job. The electrician then notified me that, as I had expected, the doorbell was defective. I spent $100 for the service call and $15 for the transformer, which wasn’t needed.<br><br>Ring replaced the unit, but refused to do anything about the $115 I was out due to their poor customer service advice.

  UPDATE: Ring did something with a new firmware patch that has fixed the night vision problem for me. It works perfectly now. Updating my rating accordingly.<br><br>When I first got this I was thrilled. The picture quality was clear, colorful, and above and beyond what I expected and installation was super easy. The app works great and itemizes each motion event and doorbell ring in a way that makes it very easy to navigate. The problem occured after the first night of it being installed when it went into night mode. At this point it uses infrared to display a black and white picture. Unfortunately, it doesn't come out of night mode during the day. The picture is constantly black and white and low res. I have to either reset the breaker or reboot the Ring to get it back to color and hi res and that only lasts until it goes into night mode again. This is a known issue for Ring and apparently a problem for users with a larger porch overhang. If you Google the problem, you will see many reddit posts about this problem. A lot of them say that Ring is aware of the problem, it's a firmware issue, and Ring is working on fixing it. Many of these posts are over a year old. I still use the Ring, because I know I'm less likely to be burglarized with it there, but if I was burglarized, the video would be virtually useless. I guess there's no use in their subscription. You'll likely see someone respond to this saying that they can help by increasing the contrast, but if you look that up you'll see many people that say that doesn't work either. It's too bad because if this thing had worked properly I would give it five stars, but it doesn't.

  When I first got the Ring doorbell setup was relatively easy and I really liked it.  Then I started having issues where I'd get motion alert but the live feed wouldn't work because of poor signal strength.  I tried putting it on both my standard and 5G networks but neither helped despite other wireless devices working just fine in the same area.<br><br>Fast forward 11 months later and I noticed I hadn't even received a motion alert in a couple weeks.  I checked on the device to find that it wasn't on, was hot to the touch, and couldn't reset.  I contacted the Ring help desk and spoke with a lady for nearly 3 hours trying to troubleshoot. She was insistent it wasn't getting enough power even though it had worked for months and the voltage going into the device was exactly what she said it should be when I used a VOM to check.  After being placed on hold for the umpteenth time, I started checking around on their website and found if there's not sufficient power they offer a complimentary power cable of some sort that can help.  When she got back on I requested that be sent to me.  I was immediately placed on hold and after 15-20mins waiting the call abruptly ended...<br><br>During that time I was doing some more research online and apparently despite being hardwired this particular device does actually have an internal battery that CANNOT be replaced and often fails after 12-16 months depending on weather conditions.  So do yourself a favor and get a different product from another manufacturer.

  Door bell looks nice, and it goes to your phone.  However, when it rings on your phone, the app opens up and then freezes.  It basically locks you out of speaking / seeing who is at your door , and when you finally get the thing working....well no one sticks around when they ring the bell and no one answers for a few minutes.<br><br>I have reached out to customer service.  All my other electronics function just fine on my wireless.  It is out of their warranty period (less than 1 year)  I asked for my money back and they refuse.  I would like to get another brand, so i am probably going to have to eat the 200.00 i spent on this, and hope this review has some clout with other buyers.<br><br>Their customer service is friendly and responsive, but they will do anything they can to avoid refunding your money.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro could be 5-Stars, but . . .",9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2019","<span>
  After using the product for nearly one year, I can say with confidence, the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is a reliable product and is backed by an EXCELLENT USA-based support team.<br><br>QUESTION:  Why not a 5-Star rating??<br>ANSWER:  UNEXPECTED POWER REQUIREMENTS.<br><br>After the Ring Pro was installed, the product did not work as expected. The video response time lagged, and the video quality was not as expected. Additionally, the original ""mechanical"" doorbell would not consistently chime when a visitor pressed the Ring Pro button. After troubleshooting with Ring's excellent tech-support, it was discovered the original doorbell TRANSFORMER was not powerful enough to operate the ""Pro"" model properly.<br><br>My home was built in 2003. I guess in those ""old days"" many homes were built with doorbell transformers rated at 16v/10va. I'm not an electrician, but Ring tech-support stated the Ring ""Pro"" model needs a transformer with a minimum rating of 16v/30va (the ""30va"" is the important part). Something tells me, even if your home was built in the last year or two -- it is likely has a ""contractor grade"" transformer that will NOT adequately power a Ring Pro.<br><br>I purchased a new 16v/30va transformer (Edwards Signaling 598 120V 8/16/24V 30W) from Amazon for $30, and I did a self-installation to avoid the additional cost of a professional electrician. By the way, locating the doorbell transformer can be a mystery -- depending on the age of your home. My transformer is located in the garage, and it was not an easy install because it is in an awkward position --11 feet off the ground (tall garage). A little advice: if you decide to install a new transformer yourself -- the electricity needs to be TURNED-OFF at the breaker box!<br><br>The new 16v/30va transformer resolved the ""video lagging"" issue. However, it did not resolve the mechanical (hard wired) wall chime operating sporadically. Again, Ring tech-support was contacted, and they suggested the original (2003) mechanical wall chime still might be demanding too much power from the transformer and suggested replacement of the NuTone chime box.<br><br>Since I had just purchased the Ring Pro AND had the unexpected expense of a new $30 transformer, I expressed to Ring tech-support -- I was not about to add the cost of a new mechanical wall chime to the scenario, and perhaps it would be better to return the Ring Pro to Amazon. Understanding this concern, Ring tech-support was kind enough to send me a RING WIRELESS CHIME free of charge.<br><br>Actually, I like the Ring Wireless Chime better than the old mechanical wall chime, and here are two reasons why:<br><br>(1) The Ring Wireless Chime offers 20 different ""ring"" chimes; plus a selection of ""motion"" chimes. The motion chimes are GREAT for when delivery drivers drop off packages at the door -- but do not ring the bell. When the Ring Wireless Chime sounds for motion at the front door area, I always check the Ring Pro camera to see if a package is sitting near the door. (An excellent feature for thwarting Porch Pirates.)<br><br>(2) I can move the Ring Wireless Chime to a different location in the house, or it can be moved to the patio when I'm working outside (electrical outlet required). That way, I always hear the doorbell ring or sound motion activity anywhere inside or outside the house.<br><br>Now, nearly one year later, I have had ZERO ISSUES with the RING PRO and highly recommend Ring's products to family and friends. However, the rationale for the 4-Star instead of 5-Star rating was based on the disappointment of encountering ""unknown power requirements"" AFTER the purchase. After checking YouTube and other online sources, apparently, operation issues around the 16v/30va power requirement are very common. I think Ring should disclose this anomaly prior to purchase -- or at least offer a discounted 16v/30va transformer for around $20 and free shipping.<br><br>All-in-all, if I were asked to recommend either a Ring Pro or a Ring doorbell model that is battery-operated, I would suggest going with the Pro model and upgrading to a 16v/30va transformer. Plus, here in the Valley of the Sun, with over 100 days of 100+ temperatures each year, batteries don't live long. So, not having to worry about heat-related battery failure is worth the extra cost and effort to install a Ring Pro.<br><br>One last thing . . .<br><br>Because Ring was EXCELLENT at resolving the electrical issues encountered with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro with quality tech-support and customer service, I recently purchased and installed the RING ALARM HOME SECURITY SYSTEM.  So far, the Ring security system is EXCELLENT, and I will talk about this product in a separate review after a few months of experience.

  Update: after a year I've dropped my rating to zero and now need to throw out my $1k investment. Live connection so seldom works and the recorded scenes always start too late after the event.  Now a backyard is stuck on infrared during the day.  Here I am blind away from home.  PATHETIC PRODUCT  I now think these are actually worse than Nest. I'm gonna have to build a soblution.<br><br>Note that maybe part of the problem is that it uses the way overloaded 2.4mhz wifi band? I got a ring booster, no change. I watched roku further away from my AP than the camera.  Not wifi, just junk.<br><br>I wanted to like this as I found Nest to be awkward to install and use.<br><br>The Ring Doorbell installed rather easily. The angled adapters don't share the same colors as the doorbell skins (my doorbell is on a side wall, so i need to angle it out to see down the walkway).<br><br>I like the motion area setup. You've got digital fences to move around to direct where to trigger on motion (walkway) and where not (street). That is a great idea and works well! (not sure why they don't retrofit this feature onto the spotlight cameras, but those are another disappointment),<br><br>The app response is really spotty and intermittent.  The idea is that it notifies you when someone is near the door - such as a postman dropping off a package - or a drone I suppose. You should be able to click the notification and see the action. Well - it doesn't always give you a timeline so you may or may not be able to pan back to the beginning of the motion event - - well, the Postman drops and runs so you see nothing by the time you can react. Then it should show up in the event history, and an entry appears! However, the link doesn't work for 5 to 10 minutes - presumably a delay in their cloud. So - you go check the front IRL. Just happened to me again, thus the annoyed sounding review.<br><br>So - I replaced my Nest cameras with this (and the spotlights) - how'd that work out?<br>- The cloud service is a little cheaper than Nest, especially if you have a bunch of their cameras.<br>- The playback is a bit smoother and the random access works more cleanly than Nest<br>- Nest has a clearer picture, and doesn't have the fisheye effect (which isn't that bad once you get used to it)<br>- The ability to be notified and respond quickly are pretty iffy for both - Ring is not bad when the doorbell is hit but falls down as described above on motion.  Nest reacts faster to motion and allows you to quickly pan back in time (although it's a sloppy process).<br>- the Battery operated floodlight cameras are great to install! - the Nest is wall powered and they put a goofy fat plug on the end so you need to drill a huge hole to get this tiny little wire through the wall.<br><br>Oh - I use Android and my wife uses iPhone.  About the same experience, iPhone might be a little zippier.<br><br>So - I dunno - how hard can this stuff be??  There must be a good system out there?

   I've only had the Ring Video Doorbell Pro for a few days.  It catches all humans and vehicles approaching the house, and has very few ""falses.""  The ability to set ""motion zones"" makes it easy to monitor just where I want to detect intrusion.  In the few days that I've owned it, I've caught all the action in the driveway and approaching the stairs to my front door.  I've caught FOXES, RACCOONS, CATS, as well as humans.<br><br>Now for the FEATURE that I didn't find in the advertising:  When an event triggers a video, THE RECORDING STARTS ABOUT FIVE SECONDS BEFORE THE EVENT, AND ENDS ABOUT A MINUTE AFTER THE EVENT ENDS!  That means, that I catch ALL the action, and don't have to wonder what happened before.  Wow!  That one feature is golden!<br><br>I should mention, that I also have a number (10) ""Blink"" cameras, and use them to know when the postman comes (I have one in the mailbox) and one in a package drop-off box.  Those have been really super, but I ""lose"" the first few seconds of an event.  That won't happen with the Ring.<br><br>The video above will demonstrate how the recording STARTS five seconds before the triggering event.

Then it does not refresh so I can try to go to Live View - No devices available, so I have to close out of the app and reopen it. I click on Live View so I can talk to the person waiting there fpr now 25 or 30 seconds with no indication that I'm trying to see who's at my door. Upon connecting to Live View, I can see a black screen with the green and red call buttons. No video or picture of the other person. It will do this no matter how many times I close out and try again. Live view works fine later on when I no longer need it. My speed at the device is very good, but it has been said that the signal is just ok. I have used the Chime Pro, both close to the wireless access point as well as closer to the Ring and also mid-way. None helped a single bit. The Chime Pro didn't seem to help with all of the issues I've had with the Pro. I have a ubiquiti lite ap about 20 feet away. Of course, no issues with other devices, even if I'm 50 feet further from the ap outside and around the corner. It's just the Ring Pro that has issues. Always has been the case. Anyway, just letting you know. I'm not going through the 100 steps that you blanketly request whenever there is an issue with your product. Just frustrated with your product and service, as usual, because it does not work more than it actually works.<br><br>Jan 15, 2018:<br>Great idea but don't. Any issues, customer service will always give you a personalized blanket response that requires a lot of items for you to find our and answer. They do this even when they know the problem lies on their end. I suspect most people give up after the 1st or 2nd email because it is too much.<br><br>I have the Ring and Ring Pro. Most of the time, they have issues of 10 minute notification delays as well as 15 minute video processing delays.

My Ring front door device is a straight 50 foot shot from my router and should work perfectly. some good news, even while the app constantly says front door ""Offline,"" and doesn't allow me to see or speak to visitors in real time, at least I can hear the door bell ring and I can still access and review previously recorded videos, but after the fact. I was hoping to see motion and people before they walked up to and/or during the knock on my door, but that never worked for me more than a day or two in a row. So far its been an expensive door bell chime that allows me to review historical videos, better than nothing! I also purchased two Ring cameras with double motion sensor lights from Costco for ~$500 for both, and those seems to work better for some reason. I wanted the Ring home alarm system to  tie into my Alexa and other devices but am now reluctant and searching for other options with better connectivity.

  First, if you want a ring doorbell, don't buy it.  Just find a house with it, put on something to obscure your face and pull it out of the wall.  It is only held in with screws and inserts.  Heck, you could even take the time to unscrew it since there is nothing to stop you from doing that but a removable cover that is held on with a screw.  The factory reset is a large button on the side.<br>Second, their help support is non-existent.  10min on hold after the automated menu and no-one picked up.<br>Third, you CAN'T change the account e-mail after you set it up.  Their website has someone asking this question but it redirects you to the custormer support line.  No-one picks up.<br>Fourth, it doesn't work with chimes that require a diode at the doorbell.<br>Fifth, lag.  Seriously.  I have someone ring the doorbell, we open the door.  They come in.  Then my phone lets me know someone is at the door.  About a minute later, the video of the people at the door loads up.<br>Sixth, they constantly want your credit card information.  If you open the app, you get a request for it.  How does a $200 doorbell need a protection plan?  For that price it should be warrantied.

  There are many defective units. Amazon is aware and investigating. Avoid buying this product until Ring fixes it or Amazon pulls the bad units. Details below:<br>During the install the unit didn't power on. The unit also came with a stripped safety screw. So quality control out of the box is bad. My initial call to Ring's tech support had me talk to a very condescending gentleman who had me troubleshoot the instruction book. After confirming, with multiple pictures, that the unit was wired correctly I pulled out my electrical multimeter and confirmed that the unit was receiving 20VAC, which it requires. They told me to ""let it charge"" for an hour or so. After several hours it still did t power on. Ring had me exchange the unit hinting that either my mechanical door chimed is not compatible or the unit is defective. I received my second unit and it also did not power on. After leaving hooked up ""to charge"" for two day I called support.  Again after running it by their tech support they acknowledge that despite their literature saying that ""All mechanical chimes are supported"" many are not. So I ran a test and installed the unit to my friends house. Again my friends doorbell supplied 20VAC to the unit, but it did not power on. I then bought an after market power kit from Ohmkat. The kit is designed to power a ring pro without an existing doorbell. Again the power supply provides 20vAC but did not power on. I then triple checked the unit by buying a 24VAC transformer and replacing my current chimes transformer. Again the unit did not power on despite receiving 24VAC at the unit. My last call with tech support they were going to mail me the Power Cable. However there has been SUCH HIGH demand for this fix kits that they are out of stock and back ordered.<br><br>I figured I'd give it one more try because I want this product to work. I exchanged the unit again through Amazon. Since I had already exchanged the unit I had to talk to some at Amazon to get approval for the third exchange. Amazons customer service said that there was an open investigation due to the exchanges. They did not confirm but heavily hinted that this is a common problem. I received my third unit today. I haven't hooked it up to my house but I hooked it up to the Ohmkat power kit. After two hours it had not powered on. I had given up and was writing this update and to my surprise it powered on.  Tomorrow I'll install it to my doorbell. I'll add to the review further if the install to my house works and if I keep it in the long run. But after reading multiple accounts of the same problem, needing two exchanges, trying two houses, and after market power supply, and both ring and Amazon saying there are issue....I heavily suggest you hold off buying until a fix or new model is released.

  Got my Ring Video Doorbell Pro about 2 weeks ago. I had to order and install a new doorbell transformer because my current one was inadequate for powering the Ring. Spent half of the day installing and troubleshooting and the damn thing still would not power on. I verified the install and the voltage at the Ring and still no joy. My guess is that the item received, being the version one model may have had a bad internal battery. After reading many online reviews and the like, I have come to the conclusion that Ring has issues with this product and are unwilling to fix them. I am unwilling to spend another afternoon trying get a replacement to work. So long Ring or should I  say Amazon as they now own Ring. I am becoming more and more discouraged with Amazon, especially there peddling of cheap Chinese crap to the American people. I have returned this product for a refund as it is defective. i will not give Ring a second chance as you only get one chance to make a first impression and my my first impression is not favorable.

  We just got a second home and I night before last this ring did phenomenal for us; suspicious characters came up to our door where one of our Amazon packages was still there And slit open the package; fortunately  they were distracted by something and left.  They  did not ring our doorbell but the video captured them at our door and walking up from the street.  I posted it to the Ring neighborhood and found out that others in the neighborhood ( which is far encompassing) had seen these people and one of them was caring a hatchet. For those of you that worried that the three dollars a month is too much, I have to ask how much is your safety worth?  I sent clear videos to the police department after they asked us to document it and send them the videos.  It would be fantastic if RING Would supply police departments with the results especially of suspicious characters or acts Of theft, violence etc. We wouldn’t trade our RING for anything.<br><br>One slight drawback is that we get traffic motion especially if cars are speeding but then we have a pretty wide range so that we can see the entire front of our house.<br><br>I also note that the Wi-Fi signal which we have an excellent router doesn’t always tell you when it’s happening— it’s almost like a slight delay.  That said, if someone waits around at the door we answer it even when we’re in another city/state.<br><br>The Alexa that they are talking about is actually a spot for a video thing I wish it worked with our Echo or Echo Dot so if we couldn’t respond to them Alexa could and maybe even scare some person in middle of night who doesn’t ring the doorbell off. LOL<br><br>Can also share your ring info videos with family so that they can monitor it for you when you can’t.  They can see a live version, any alerts that have been there and also the neighborhood Reports. A win-win situation.

  I was forced to remove my Arlo Pro 1080p security camera due to the new HOA managing our town home complex.  They only allow for doorbell style cameras therefore, the reason why I purchased this device.  PROS: took less than 1 hour to install, connects well to WiFi, gives relatively quick access to recorded motion events.  CONS: there is no way the video quality is as reported at 1080p - the quality is more on par with SD and due to this at times facial features are non-identifiable, the sound quality is often times very distorted, the motion sensor is way to sensitive - picking up people walking 15 feet from our front door on the sidewalk, and lastly the iOS app isn’t the best.

Subsequent models should be fixed.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Ring Pro-works well for 1-2 years-then you'll need to replace,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2018","<span>
  Bottom line:  Bought my Ring Pro in July 2016.  It just died.  The device is now a brick because there's an internal, unreplaceable battery that will die at some point past your warranty requiring you to replace the entire device with a new one.  BE PREPARED TO BUY ONE EVERY 1-2 YEARS.  More below.<br><br>Overall, the Ring Pro (hardwired) doorbell is a decent product that mostly delivers on the advertisement.  Good resolution, adequate motion detection with an ability to set zones, good app mobile app.  I've enjoyed having it to be able to check who's at the door and find it particularly helpful in monitoring deliveries.<br><br>However, there are some problems.  It will often drop off the network for a period of time and require reconnection which is annoying since you actually have to unscrew the cover to get to the wifi reset button.  Other times, it doesn't actually notify you in real time that someone is at the door.  It doesn't really ring the internal chime of the original doorbell and I had to buy the Ring Chime to get better notification. Video quality has declined in the 2 years since we've owned it, largely as a result of Ring software 'upgrades.'<br><br>As some other reviewers have noted, there is a subscription service required for cloud backup of video.  And as Ring updates software, it sometimes 'breaks' the system for awhile.<br><br>However the biggest thing I've learned in the last day or so is that even though this $250 doorbell is hard-wired into the existing powered doorbell system, the Ring Pro has an internal Lithium ion battery because your average doorbell transformer can't supply enough power to operate the device.  This battery, according to numerous Reddit threads (simply Google ""ring doorbell died"" and look for the first Reddit thread in the results) actually powers some of the functionality.<br><br>THE BATTERY IS NOT REPLACEABLE AND WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL.  When this happens, your $250 investment is worthless.  Heat is not your friend in terms of these batteries--those of you in hot climates or with Rings installed in the sun are likely to see faster degradation of the battery.  So you're paying $250 for a 366 day investment or if you're lucky like I was, you're paying $125/year for a smart doorbell.<br><br>Not sure yet if I'll buy another.  Looking at Nest and other alternatives.

  This was my second Ring Video Pro and first Echo Show. I bought a second Ring Pro for my side door after loving the one that was installed on my front door. Coupled with the Echo Show makes this a no brainer. It is great being able to go ""Alexa, show me the front/side door"", and then having the live feed of the Ring show up next to my bed.<br><br>Now, some people may complain about the cloud service, but I don't find it being an issue. The $3 a month per device, or $10 a month for unlimited devices is not a bad deal. This is especially true if you go with a Protected by Ring Alarm system. What other company can give you professional alarm monitoring with video cloud storage for $10 a month?<br><br>Also, note that this is the Ring Video Pro; pay special attention to the ""Pro"" in the word there. This doorbell must be hardwired, and a transformer capable of delivering the proper voltage must also be installed. I would recommend professional installation, but it isn't required if you are comfortable working with low voltage wiring, basic electricity and own the proper tools. I've noticed a lot of the negative reviews seem to be from individuals that tried to install the device themselves without the proper skill level or tools. I myself had to install a new transformer that was able to deliver the needed power to two Ring Video Pros.<br><br>I also had to adjust the motion zones and motion sensitivity on both of my doorbells. This was simply a trial and error process, but in the end it was worth it; this is a must if you live on a busy road and your Ring can see the road.

  There is no local storage option on this device for storing video history like many other products. Further, there is no time limited free option for cloud storage.  After 30 days, you will have to pay a monthly fee to be able to view video history.  Compare with some of the Arlo products that include both an SD card slot and free 7-day cloud storage.<br>  Wish I had paid more attention before installing.<br><br>Also, the lag between motion detection and alert is pretty bad.  For example if someone drops off a package at your door, typically you won't see them until their back is turned.  And yes my Internet connection is very good.

  The Ring Doorbell Pro worked great out of the box... for about 3 months.  Now we have major issues and can't get Ring to help us at all.  They have the worst customer service department we've ever had to deal with personally.<br><br>We noticed this past month, the two way talk doesn't always work when someone rings the doorbell.  Our voice sounds like a machine if it comes through at all.  After about 45 seconds it then becomes clear enough to for people to understand we are speaking to them and works fine after that.<br><br>Our newest issue, happens ALL THE TIME now, when someone rings the doorbell:<br>1.) We can't access the live feed.<br>2.) We can't even access the video/camera for about 10 minutes after the doorbell is pressed.<br>3.) When we are able to view the recording, it's frozen just after the doorbell is pressed. Nothing else gets recorded after that.<br><br>We have reset the camera and nothing fixed the issues. We reached out to Ring directly and were told our internet speed is too slow for the doorbell.  We are in a brand new home with a new modem/router and 300mbps internet speed.  Most of our devices are hardwired.  When someone rings the bell... no one is home even using the internet. We have had zero issues with internet speed on any other device in our home.  In addition, the doorbell has worked fine - up until this past month and nothing internet wise has changed in our home. The guy told me to contact our internet provider as it's impossible the problem is the doorbell. (Wow!!)  So, just to cover all our bases... we did.  Our ISP provider tested our connection, the modem and our speeds. Asked us questions about other devices and said there is NO ISSUE with our internet that because the problem is only with one device, it's a clear indicator it's the device and not the internet.  I again, reached out to Ring and was told again, it's an internet issue.  They refuse to repair/replace the doorbell even though it's within the manufactures warranty time frame.  They claim there is no other test they can do.  No help at all.<br><br>Normally I would still recommend a product like this, if the company backs it up and provides full support.  However, Ring failed us.They wouldn't even TRY to help us.  It was just very poor customer service all around and for this reason, I would tell people to buy from a different manufacturer.

  Despite reading a lot of terrible reviews of this product, I still decided to buy a Ring doorbell.  Somehow I figured most of the 1-star reviews were just outliers, people who could not figure out how to set this thing up.  Not so!  I tried the Ring, the Ring 2, the Ring Pro, the only real difference as far as I can tell is the price &amp; the box they came in.<br><br>Why is this easily the WORST PURCHASE OF 2017?  #1 It will not stay synced with the wireless.  My high speed router is 20 feet max from where the Ring is mounted.  It would be a direct line of site if I didnt have a front door, but even at such a close distance &amp; no interference, it will not stay connected.  I’ve wasted a considerable amount of time unscrewing the Ring so I can resync it with my wireless.  In addition, I’ve done this with Ring support a handful of times, tried out various Ring models, &amp; even purchased an extender, no luck.<br><br>#2 when it actually does work, and that’s rare, the video takes a good 10-20 seconds before anything shows on the screen.  The commercials show someone ringing the bell &amp; the homeowner quickly opening the app to say ‘hello’.  Reality could not be more different.  90% of the time, the screen is completely black because it can’t stream the image.  The audio works better but its choppy &amp; delayed.<br><br>#3 I also made the mistake of signing up for the 1 Year Subscription so I could replay the videos (see #1 and #2 above).  It’s almost funny watching the videos, 90% are the black screen, &amp; the remaining 10% the Ring shows that someone rang the bell, but there’s no video of anyone coming to the door (i.e. the video does not start until AFTER they’ve left).  Another commercial shows the homeowner watching the UPS guy drop off packages, HA!!!!  All mine shows is that the doorbell rang, no other record exists.<br><br>I could go on, but its easier just to admit that I foolishly wasted money on a BS product that does not work because I did not believe the 1 star reviews.....buyer beware!!!!

  My first 6 months with the Ring Pro were great. Good video quality, motion alerts are easy to set up, decent sound quality, relatively low latency, and the ring never disconnected or stopped working.<br><br>Around month 6 (in the middle of summer), I started seeing corrupt videos coming from the Ring Pro. I would get motion alerts when there was no motion, and when I looked at the video I saw random colored stripes appearing in the video and apparently causing the motion alert. I reset power to the device and the problem went away for a few weeks.<br><br>Then the problem came back, except it actually froze the video. So the Ring Pro became useless. It just kept sending out the same pictures over and over.<br><br>After going back and forth with support through their generic troubleshooting process for a week or two , they finally sent me a new Ring Pro. This one had an improved heat sink on the back, which confirmed what I suspected --- the Ring Pro's electronics were not holding up to the heat of summer.<br><br>Unfortunately, 10 days in this replacement Ring Pro has a dead WiFi module.<br><br>At this point, my Ring Pro has only worked for 10 days out of the last 60.<br><br>At this price point, Ring Pro could be building high quality doorbells with components rated for high temperature.

My brother finally looked it up and it turns out getting dead products is very common with the ring pro. Many people have posted about their frustrations with this doorbell and how they returned them and got other broken ones several times. Several of them even said that customer support recommended getting the lower tier model instead of the Pro. They should recall these and refund us for our troubles.

  So, I bought the PRO because I heard of all the updates on the reviews.  Apparently, there are still issues with this system, primarily due to the technically finicky nature of this product.  The first unit I received install easily enough, but upon setup, it was unable to find the Ring network at all.  I went through troubleshooting on the phone with one of their CS folks and after several reboots, re-installs and the like, he said that I may be the recipient of a bad unit with a known issue where network syncing fails to happen and so they instructed me that they would send a replacement and to send the ""unresponsive"" unit back.<br>Round 2:  So, about a week later, I received the replacement unit.  I went through complete install again and was excited when alas, the Ring network was visible on the phone app!  Yay, right?  Not so fast.  I was able to sync it fine and then, to my utter dismay, the thing failed my first test.  It did not register motion and did not send me any notifications when I tried t ring it.  So, I called Ring again and the CS person walked me though some more testing and finally asked me to do some signal diagnostics.  I did that with him several times only to finally have him tell me that my internet/network service provider was the issue.  Really?  I have Verizon Fios and NEVER lose signal or have any latency issues, yet he was trying to blame it on that.  Very frustrated once again at this point.  I REALLY wanted to have this system, but until they work out all the finickiness of this thing or have someone who can actually troubleshoot it to the point of successful operation, I cant recommend it to anyone :(((.

My dad did the initial install six months ago when I bought the house so I don’t know what kind of Power Kit I have. Then it asks me what my name is. My name is Nunya Fkn Bizness. I paid you; you don’t need to know what my name is. Then it says to go select the Ring network from my Wi-Fi on my phone. well for one, I’m not using my phone because Ring developers are not smart enough to make an app that works on my phone, so I’m using my iPad.

  We have three Ring video doorbells.  Hard to imagine living without one now days.  All worked as advertised up until a few days ago.  That's when the first, our ""hardwired"" $250 Ring Video Doorbell ""Pro""---the most expensive one---died after 27 months in service.  Power is good but the device does not respond to the push-button or over the WiFi (see photo).  No lights, no noise, no good.<br><br>Given our cost of $250 for 27 months of useful life that works out to a monthly hardware cost of $9.26---plus the Ring Cloud recording change of $3.33 per month.  Is $12.50 per month worth it?  Personally I do not think so.<br><br>The device is sealed up good, meaning disassembly, inspection and/or repair is not possible.  The device was installed under our front porch roof and never gets wet.  Here in Southern California we do not get much rain at all.  We are close to the Pacific Ocean, but if that environment was an issue I'd expect notice of that on Ring's Website or in its user documentation!<br><br>Waiting for the other two units to die now.  Time to look for an alternative option?  Probably! :-)<br><br>UPDATE: 12/13/2019<br><br>To my great surprise Ring contacted me soon after this ""one-star"" review was first posted.  I talked to an actual person who told me Ring would send me a replacement video doorbell at no charge---plus send me a shipping label to return the failed unit.  That was despite the fact that the original device is now out-of-warranty.<br><br>Wow!  I've changed my rating to ""four-stars"".  It is not a ""five-star"" product---yet---but is is getting better with every update of the device firmware and mobile app software.<br><br>The most frustrating thing remains the sometimes long delay before one can actually see what triggered a motion alert and/or after requesting a ""live view"".  Too bad the device can't send video DIRECTLY to my mobile app whenever BOTH are connected to the same WiFi network! :-)

  Since day one, I've had nothing but trouble. Initially Tech Support told me I needed to replace my doorbell transformer. I called an electrician to replace the transformer but it still didn't work. I was told the transformer wasn't compatible but product info showed it was. Finally I spoke with a different tech support who found that I had simply set my Ring Pro for digital ring rather than mechanical. The expense &amp; time I'd spent replacing the transformer was unnecessary. I also didn't realize that I'd have to pay a monthly fee after 30 days to see video except real time.  I also had trouble with the newspaper delivery person setting off motion sensor every night even after multiple adjustments. Since I installed my Ring Pro, I haven't been able to answer anyone at my door from my phone.  One time it had logged me off and I had that corrected. Other times I show there is someone at my door but haven't been able to get a screen to show for me to answer. Last week I was in my backyard when someone rang the bell and I was waiting for them but could not respond from my phone. I had to literally run around my house and stop them before the got into their vehicle. Again I found I had been logged out.  Today the same thing happened, I showed I'd been logged out and by the time I was able to log back in, there was no point. Friends who had the Ring in years past had recommended it but at this point, after many hours on the phone with tech support and no resolution, I am sorry I bought the unit. Another irritating feature is that when I do log in, it oges to the Neighbors Team showing videos of suspects in my County rather than going to my device.

  $300 plus doorbell quit working after a couple of months. RING told me to call electrician. I paid my electrician to look at it, and he said it was the doorbell, not the electric. Called RING back -- they then said I needed a ""power kit and cable."" When it came, it was the wrong piece. RING refused to take responsibility, and refused to exchange doorbell, instead claiming that I needed a DIFFERENT part. So... I'm out more than $300 for the doorbell, plus the cost of my electrician looking at it again, the thing still doesn't work, and RING won't help.

  This review is for the Ring door bell pro wired version.<br><br>Pro’s<br>The month you get free access to the missed activity and saved videos at the door the product is the kinda overpriced.<br><br>Con’s<br>After the month of free access it’s useless, unless you pay for subscription service. If you don’t pay they also will delete your old videos.<br> You can’t see any missed activity which was the reason for purchase. I had seen conflicting reviews that people stated that you could see missed activity after free trial expired. I confirm you cannot see activity and any you had gets deleted!<br><br>Also I actually tried to answer the ring after the free trial expired and that feature appears disabled as the mailman could not hear me. That function worked while the free subscription was still valid.<br> This product is kinda cool but at $200 for the device then paying a monthly or yearly cost for it to function as designed it’s kinda a kick in pants once the free subscription runs out.<br>I was going to buy two of the ring lights but now I’ll look at other options.

  I've had multiple problems with the Ring Pro doorbell from Day 1: the microphone allowing you to talk to your visitor simply doesn't work. The sound is garbled and cuts out. When the motion detector alerts you to a visitor, the camera often fails to connect to the smartphone, leaving you clueless as to who your visitor is.<br>  I bought a WiFi extender, hoping that would fix the problem, but the Ring Pro still doesn't work right. It finally failed to connect with my existing doorbell completely &amp; I was forced to use a cheap plug-in doorbell which the people at Ring sent me. It was at that point that I bought a regular doorbell and replaced the Ring doorbell completely.<br>  Perhaps they will get the technology down right some day, but it's clear that they have a long way to go. I would give the product zero stars (if that were possible), but I have to give credit to the Ring Customer Service staff - the times I contacted them, they genuinely seemed to care and didn't hesitate to send out replacement parts in an attempt to get my doorbell working. Unfortunately, their efforts (and mine) were in vain.

  Please don’t ever expect this thing to work properly. It works when it feels like it. I can only name one time that it worked out of the dozens and dozens and dozens of times it needed to work.  I have 400 MB download capacity in my house so Internet is not problem.  But if someone rings your doorbell by the time it actually connects to video that person is long gone so don’t ever plan on talking to UPS or the mail lady when they come to the house.  This thing is remarkably disappointing. The concept is brilliant however the operation is minimal at best and criminal at worst.  Don’t bother unless you want to have many frustration filled hours.

  We purchased the Ring Pro about 1.5 years ago.  It's nice when it works, but it does not work reliably at all - we've had some sort of issue with it on about a monthly basis.  We've had 2 package thefts since it was installed - one was captured and the other was missed due to a device malfunction!  I've spent countless hours troubleshooting the device and contacting customer service.  We are currently on our 3rd device, which has also stopped working and now we are waiting for yet another replacement.  I have replaced the transformer, replaced all of the wiring, and confirmed the device is getting the correct voltage.  The monthly fees for access to recordings is also a major rip off, and was not clearly disclosed pre-purchase documentation.

  Like most modern electronics, if you plug it in and it works, it is a marvel.  But if you plug it in and it doesn't, it is a nightmare.<br>Mine is the nightmare.<br>Allow me to explain and to warn those who may have an older home.  The Ring doorbell REQUIRES 16v to 24v to operate.  Older doorbell systems (that means the transformer that is connected in your wiring system to provide the low voltage to your doorbell buttons and chimes) use lower voltage, 12v and maybe less.  Ring WILL NOT WORK ON THAT VOLTAGE.<br>If Ring's site, advertisements, and tech support would simply state the above, a lot of frustration and cursing (and waste of money) could be avoided.  But the company presents a cheery facade, and leaves their customers to figure this issue out on their own.<br>If you know where your home's doorbell wiring transformer is located, it's not a big deal to swap it to another transformer to provide proper voltage.  I'm not that lucky. My house has no basement, and the wiring in the attic is under insulation; likely the transformer is behind a wall somewhere.  It'll cost $500 to $1000 for me to hire an electrician to make the change, or it'll take me an equivalent amount of time to do it myself.  ....  to install a $200 doorbell.<br>Forewarned is forearmed.

  I bought the Ring on sale (~$190), because I had heard some great things about it and wanted some added security.  The device was easy to install, and worked like a champ right out of the box.  I enjoyed the video, quick downloads, and added peace of mind.  I was surprised to learn that there was a three month trial to keep videos, and after that, it was $30/year for the access.  Didn't make sense, but won't be the last time I make an uninformed purchase.  The three months got away from me, and all of a sudden, I can't even watch live video, or talk to someone at the door.  Another couple weeks, and  I then noticed it was no longer connected to the internet.  I tried reconnecting, but now it is magically out of range of the wi-fi network, and wants me to purchase a wi-fi extender?  I'm not a tech guy, just wanted something easy for added piece of mind.  I have no problem with fast download speeds for movies or gaming on the front porch, but this thing can't even get a signal now?  I'd rather change it out for a cheaper and better rated video doorbell.

  We have a Ring Video Doorbell Pro on our front door and one on our back door (the electric wire was already installed by builder).  They work great and were easy to install. The Ring App allowed us to adjust the settings for our needs.  That was very important for the products to perform at the level we expect. You can set the sensitivity level or range for field of view. That is important for ALL Ring Products.  We also have several Ring Stick-up Cameras that plug in or are solar powered.  We have one Spotlight Cam that is plugged in.  We have three Ring Smart Lighting Flood Lights that are hard-wired (I did the install. May require electrician) and 4 Ring Chime Pro Wi-fi range extenders. The lights are set to NOT come on ""at all"" during the day and only after 11:00 pm if motion is detected. You decide. Very flexible. No one can approach our property without us seeing who it is or hearing the ""barking dogs"" from the Chime Pro. What a cool feature. We decided on the dogs, but there are many other choices for the alert sound.  We can see a camera view from Alexa or any of our Smart 55"" television sets. Sometimes Alexa is slow. Go bake some cookies or complain to your internet provider:)  The cameras work great folks. We have the motion setting set to ""people only"" to keep alerts at a minimum.  We pay $10 per month for the service.  A great price.  We delete the camera clips every day or so to keep storage at a minimum. The App works great and Windows 10 works great, too.  We don't understand the negative reviews. Sometimes the internet connection gets slow or is down for some reason.  That's life.  Re-boot and have a great day!

  Setup is very easy, and everything you need (except a drill) is included in the box. They even include a drill bit and screwdriver.<br>I'd personally follow the instructions for setup via video in the app or online on their website as it's much easier to follow than the paper instructions included. For the latter, it's best to view the setup video before purchase to see if the device is compatible with the current setup have in your home. Hardware setup took me around 20-30mins and the only hard part about the setup is the wiring which the instructional video and labels make it simple and clear to follow.<br><br>Software setup is much easier. You just download the app, make an account, link the app to your wireless connection and sync the device.<br>After installing, for the first few hours it will work flawlessly, then it will have connection issues, where you have to contact customer support. My friend and I had this issue. You have to call the support number when this happens for a hard reset, like when calling Comcast to reset your router for your internet a few times a year.<br><br>There is a subscription service involved, but is not required. Subscription service is basically for cloud video storage. The Ring device is always on and when someone rings the doorbell it records/saves the first 10secs before the press the doorbell until the camera notices it's clear and stops recording. You can also set up motion sensors for recording, and even share videos of suspicious activity with Ring users around the neighborhood.  You can view the recorded videos at anytime once it's automatically recorded.<br><br>Subscription fee is $3 a month, or $30 a year ($2.5 a month). They give you a 30 day free trail to start.<br><br>If you decided not to subscribe, you'll lose the video recording and sharing feature. I'd say the $30 a year is worth it for peace of mind.<br><br>Without a subscription, you are able to:<br>1. Answer to door through voice on your smart phone. You can see them and they can't see you, but you can chat with them instead of having to use the door peep hole or look through our window blinds. This is great when you're in your underwear and want to answer the door before an important guests think no one is home then leaves.<br><br>2. When not home, you able to answer the doorbell like #1 in real time. You will get phone notification when the button is pressed.<br>If you have the subscription it will record everything that is happening  as mentioned before, just in case you're busy and not able to answer the door via the app in time. Regardless of no subscription or subscription it will time stamp when the doorbell is rung in the history section<br><br>3. Able to monitor the front yard at anytime via the app. Just in case you're part of neighborhood watch for a burglar or suspicious person. Also good for keeping an eye out on the kids if they play out front. You can also call out to them when dinner is ready.<br><br>Camera quality is really good. Similar to most back facing smart phone camera these days, but with a fish eye lens. Night vision camera quality is a bit lower, but you're able to make out things in detail<br><br>Speaker quality is good also as it's slightly louder than smartphones when they're on speaker phone.<br><br>Door bell ring. You can set it for digital or use your existing doorbell. I'd go for the latter if you live in a large home and not in the living room (or close to it) often as the digital ring can a bit low. The doorbell does not let off repeated rings (in case your guests are button happy). May be a negative or positive depending on how you view it. You will get alerted in both the app notification/sound and the door bell itself.<br><br> Overall, very good doorbell that triples as a security cam, and one way video conference with guests.

  Don’t buy this or anything from ring.  Their product has major flaws and their customer service is terrible.  My ring pro (not at all professional) malfunctioned more than 5 times in the first month.  It was getting excessively hot and either the camera or mic would stop working.  After several failed attempts to troubleshoot Ring sent a new device and told me to return the original to them.  The second had a different design with what looked like ridges on the back similar to heat dispersing ridges to aid in cooling.  Evidently it didn’t work either because the second ring malfunctioned on the first day.  I called support to say I wanted a refund and they said they would refund after sending it back.  2 weeks later now they say they won’t refund the taxes because it was purchased from Amazon and not them.  Not only have I been waiting for the refund for weeks but now I’m out the taxes.  The agent said the other agent should have mentioned that.  I will NEVER purchase a ring product again.

  I'm a bit of a research nerd, and after reading hundreds of reviews from various sources, I admit my enthousiasm about my impending Ring Pro purchase was a little dampened. However, after two weeks of frequent daily use, I'm excited to report that I experienced none of the technical issues reported by others! It was super easy to install and set up (I watched a YouTube video prior to beginning--research nerd! haha), and my Netgear AC 1900 has had zero issues keeping up with streaming demands. The router is on the first level approximately 20 feet from the front door. There is the standard light/sound unavoidable physics-type delay with the audio using the Talk feature, but it doesn't impede normal conversational flow. I purchased Ring Pro because solicitors are a huge headache in our neighborhood, and recently this irritation took a more sinister turn when a series of break-ins and home invasions cropped up in our area. The group responsible was found to be using a door-to-door sales ploy to case homes. I generally avoid answering the door during the day when I'm by myself and needed a way to screen visitors. It's a challenge in our open living/kitchen area which is lined front and back with large windows. Ring makes it easy for me to see whether I actually need to come to the door or not. What really sold me, though, was an unexpected purpose I found for it. I have elementary aged children who are starting to enter the level of responsibility where I feel comfortable leaving them home alone for brief periods. They have close relationships with many of our neighbors who are also home during the day, but without a LAN line and them not having cell phones, it was a bit risky. With Ring, if I'm running a few minutes late running errands, I can use Live View to watch them walk from the bus to the house, and, once on the porch, engage the Talk feature to let them know I'll be home soon. Even better, if they need me, all they have to do is ring the doorbell to alert my phone and engage Talk. They haven't needed me yet, but it's reassuring for me to know that in those minutes before I make it home, I can easily handle everything from settling an argument over the remote to reminding them what to do if they need an adult presence immediately. All in all one of the best purchases I've made. In a few more years when we have teens we'll probably go full-blown security system, but for now Ring Pro has exceeded every expectation. For those interested in the customer service and support angle, I have no feedback to offer there. Haven't needed it! :)

   After a guy came pounding on our door at 10:00pm wanting to ""use our phone"", we made a few changes. By the way, we didn't open the door. First off, we got a ""Dawn to Dusk"" porch light because we had forgotten to turn our light on. We're sure he was attracted to our house because it was dark. When we couldn't give the police a good description , we needed to have a video camera. After seeing the ads for Ring, we checked it out and were impressed. We got the Ring Doorbell Pro because we already had a wired doorbell and it looks most like a regular doorbell<br><br>We now alerted  when anybody comes to our door, even when they just knock. We know when the mailman comes, when UPS makes a delivery or when we have visitors at 3:00am (see below). We can be anywhere when getting an alert. The ladies at work are just as interested as me to see who's at my door.<br><br>We opted for the $30.00/yr. option to save video for 6 months. If we're not home when a shady character comes to the door it will take longer then 15 minutes to get the police involved.

  This doorbell is impossible to install. We called Ring support 3 times, and they told us to buy something different each time to make it work. We completely replaced our transformer to a 20VA (like they said to do), but when we called back another support person said that apparently you need a 30VA transformer, which we cant find in any store. They also had us rewire our doorbell, which also didn't work. After 3 full days working on this, we are giving up and returning.

  I replaced my Nest doorbell for a Ring a couple months ago as I didn't care for Google's policies and the app wasn't really integrated that well into the Home suite.<br><br>Well, turns out that Ring isn't any better on any front except for maybe a slightly better app. The camera works well and I've subscribed to their service since it doesn't really work without it. All these doorbell products are just a bait and switch. Without the service, if you don't look at the camera quickly enough, it's a history event and has a rather horrible user experience. So plan on an annual fee to actually use this for what it says it does.<br><br>Installation was easy. Took about 10 minutes and I didn't have any issues. Compared to the Nest, Ring's doorbell doesn't really look as nice and it certainly doesn't feel as sturdy. The base and way it attaches to the way feels almost flimsy whereas the Nest looked and felt more like it was part of the wall. Not to be too critical on the looks - the Ring looks ok - just don't think it looks as nice as the Nest.<br><br>I was disappointed that this doesn't really integrate into Alexa or the Alexa app any better than it does. I've still really got to have a separate app installed to use it. The app works well enough and I've not had any problems with it. I have MFA turned on and have had no negative experiences with the app and extra authentication.<br><br>The part that gets me is how liberal Ring is with my data. Their app gives away the farm on your personal life. Do a simple search for Ring app giving away data and you'll see where it's been found (as of Jan 2020 anyway) that the amount of data that Ring decides to just throw out there to Facebook (yes, even if you don't have anything to do with Facebook), Google and others. Highly disappointing and had I known that beforehand, I would not have purchased this product.<br><br>So, the doorbell sort of works without subscribing to a service. Although to get the full functionality, you have to pay $$ annually. And then as if that weren't enough for them to make money off you after you've bought the product, they then sell your private data to make more off you. Win-win for them I suppose.

  I am disappointed with the Ring products.<br><br>The first Ring doorbell (Standard) I purchased (January 2, 2017) and received would not connect. This was an easy installation, the transformer had worked the standard push button doorbell for many years, and all voltages confirmed with a volt meter that it was working as designed. I spent a good 90 minutes working on the issue only to have to email customer service for assistance.<br><br>The Ring tech support, after a few email exchanges, came to the conclusion that this was a Wifi issue. They were good enough to offer to send me a Chime, hoping that would fix the issue.  However, it did not.<br><br>So round two they wanted to replace the mounting plate, After installing the new mounting plate, it appeared to solve my issue and life is good, well so I thought.<br><br>Fast forward to September 14, 2018 when I decided to upgrade my doorbell to the PRO model.  Sounded like it was far better than the old standard model.<br><br>The new doorbell was again an easy installation, one minor component at the transformer and replace like for like, this was easy.<br><br>Fast forward a months, October 2018.  I took my old doorbell to the other house so I could make sure things were always good there.  Well, this installation required all my skills as there was no transformer to install too.  I had to wire in a transformer and connect the doorbell.  It's a good thing I had a great teacher.<br><br>So with both doorbells up and running I was very excited.<br><br>Well fast forward to January 2019, I am back at the original house and my wife is at the second house.  Now the reason I only give Ring a 1 star.  The get one for the amazing still picture quality that they offer on my phone.  The reason they loose 4 starts, The picture quality, even though amazing, is so choppy (along with audio) that I can walk about 10 feet and the frame stops and starts bringing me in and/or out, all choppy.  That loss of picking up a person until they are at the door or even inside is so un-secure that these devices are not worth what I paid for them.  And then to not record while someone is in view is even a higher risk.  A person could literally hide their face and watch their time and then when recording stops, uncover and go about the dirty business.<br><br>So lets talk about the choppy audio.  Again after several emails to the Ring Tech, they advised me that a simple reset of the device would solve this issue, yes it did for about 30 days.  The new unit, PRO, is so bad my wife, who is at the second house for the winter, will only say hi on the Ring.  She can't hear a word I am telling her after about 10 seconds so we can't have any conversations.  I guess I need to reset the unit again, and that requires removing the device from the house and then reinstalling it on the house.  This task looks like it needs to be done every few weeks in order to have a conversation with someone outside my house.<br><br>The Android software has never crashed until Ring shut me down.  I had money in the account but they still chose to stop any activity until I reset the account to a full 2x recording costs for a year.<br><br>This appears to be a great product but has many features that need improved.  I'll am so disappointed in what I have done, might just shut down the standard unit and bring that unit back to the original house as it worked best here.  Then I might just trash the PRO as it doesn't work as expected.

  Don't waste your money, I installed and the product and it worked OK (not great) for about 8 hours, it then went bad causing a loud electrical buzz and started to burn up my door bell. Even worse than the door bell itself was their customer service who read off a script as most do these days.  I sent photos in and they confirmed everything was installed properly, they then told me that the power kit was defective but  then said they weren't sure, then went on to say that my door bell wasn't compatiable even though it is the exact door bell in the video. I guess several door bells are not compatible. Not worth the trouble, better off putting in a Nest camera which I know are reliable.

Supposed to have video pop up when motion detector is activated. I believe this reneged on their promises for services and they have defrauded me. The equipment and electricians were not cheap and now that money was wasted. What a bitter disappointment.<br><br> Wanted this so my disabled wife could see what was going on at the front door. Was hoping the live view was continuous, but not. In fact,  the live view won't work at all. Finally got the motion detection to work, does well. Works fine when the doorbell is pushed. Slight delay between pushing and chime sounding is not a big deal. Wife is ok with the motion detection and doorbell activation, so we'll keep it. Wish the live view worked.<br><br>Customer service at Ring read my review, contacted me, and fixed everything. Ended up sending a bypass and Chime (free) to bypass the original doorbell and increase current to get all the Ring's activities working just fine. Since everything is now working as it should, I have increased my review to 5 stars. Really great device.<br><br>Well, after installing the bypass, Chime, updating, etc., the Live View still does not work. First the Chime quit working when the Doorbell was pushed. Deleted, reinstalled. Now the chime works, but Live View is out again. Tried to get help via Ring and the in-app help and haven't heard a thing. I want to give up on it and get surveillance cameras and intercoms, but my wife doesn't. So, we are keeping an expensive system that does not work as described or desired. Hopefully others won't have as much disappointment. Recommend looking into surveillance systems and weighing the cost vs frustration.<br><br>While I still cannot give this doorbell a five star, the company is amazing. They ended up sending me a new Ring Pro, which I installed. Still had problems with it. Dierre, my contact at Ring, kept trying things and having me try things to get it to work properly. Still had issues with no live view, bell not ringing, camera working intermittently, other pains. Dierre and Ring kept working to try and solve. When nothing else worked, they ended up sending out a technician to troubleshoot at my home.<br><br>To recap: I purchase the ring here at $220.00. Ring sent me a bypass and Chime ($30.00), a new Ring ($220.00 min), sent a technician ($80.00/hr min), and countless hours from Dierre and others at Ring to clear up my problems. I may not be thrilled with the bell (which does work now, with reservations), but I am extremely impressed with the company. Don't know of very many businesses that go that far past the point of diminishing returns, but they have drastically increased this customer's satisfaction.<br><br>If you are interested in getting this type of home home security, get a Ring. You probably won't have the problems I have, but any you do have will be handled by Ring until you are satisfied with the results.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Performance not as expected/can't be reset remotely  - I would not buy this item again.,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2017","<span>
  When it works, this product is very good (4 stars).  However, it didn't have a great range from my wifi/modem (45 feet, no material walls to interrupt the signal), so I subsequently needed to also purchase a wifi booster which solved the initial problem.  However, when it recently stopped recording for reasons unknown to Ring Support, I learned it needed to be reset which requires your physical presence at the doorbell, including dismantling the doorbell cover, pressing a reset button, and more.  Having purchased this device for a vacation home where I am absent for many months at a time, when the doorbell for no apparent reason went offline after the first 6 weeks, it became essentially useless unless I find someone to go to my home and follow the various instructions as to how to reset the device.  And of course, if it happens again in a day or a week, or whatever, then the reset drill has to be repeated.  I had anticipated that if these devices went off line due to a power outage, internet outage or otherwise, they could be reset remotely either automatically or via the Ring App as can be done with other remote cameras of similar price, however, apparently this is not the case.  I never would have purchased this product if I had understood these shortcomings.  One would think people who buy these types of items would need them to work/keep working on an ongoing basis, otherwise it defeats a good portion of its purpose.  Ring Support basically told me: sorry, that's the way it is/they can't do anything about it.

  As of last year, ring pushed an update so the device will not ring your internal(inside house) chime if the temperature reaches 135. I live in a colder state. For 2 hours my front door gets sunlight. If someone comes to my door I can't tell unless I have my phone near me. This seems like a huge flaw. The camera and everything function except it will not chime indoors. I was told that this is a safety reason because it gets too hot, well it doesn't get too hot for the camera or the wifi module. But it somehow is too hot for the basic part of how a doorbell works. How does my regular doorbell not overheat then when I had it. This seems like a big flaw in the development of the product. Again I live in a colder state. Seems like this device would never work if I lived in Arizona, Texas, California etc.

  We had some trouble getting it setup, but after a lengthy phone call with customer service, we were good to go.  There were times when it couldn't connect for no apparent reason, which was annoying, but it's technology.. I expect glitches here and there to some degree. But overall, it worked.  Fast forward exactly one year later... This thing barely works.  It inexplicably stopped triggering our mechanical doorbell, which is less than 6 months old - so we know it's not the actual doorbell.  So when someone rings our doorbell, we don't know unless our phone is in our hand and the ringer is on.  Now it's telling us there's all kinds of connection problems whenever we try to connect.  After troubleshooting, we're told it's our internet connection.  Really?  We're on 100mbps internet with an amazing router less than 100ft away.  If the doorbell can't deal with that, then there's a big problem.<br><br>$250 was not worth a video doorbell for one year.  Would not buy again.

  I bought this in Summer 2017 and paid $100 for a licensed electrician to install it in my home (I didn't have a pre-existing chime, so additional wiring was required).  Now, at the end of summer 2019, I have a couple hundred dollars' worth of useless plastic attached to my home.<br>Pros:<br>-I got one FedEx employee written up for literally throwing a box marked ""fragile"" on my doorstep.<br>-Sometimes I got motion notifications and the video would be a cute bird catching a bug attracted to my porch plants.<br>-You can change the sound of the chime (in the app and in the peripheral, see below) to some fun seasonal options, like a wolf howling for Halloween.<br>-The Ring neighbors app is, in theory, a good place to see videos other users have posted of sketchy things. In practice, it's mostly rich white people being racist about ""strange people"" knocking on their door.  Mostly what look like kids trying to raise funds for their soccer teams.  I call this a pro because I at least get to laugh at paranoia and call out people in my own socioeconomic demographic for being jerks.<br>Cons:<br>-CONSTANT motion sensors going off, no matter how much you fine tune your ""zones"" and ask the sensor to only focus on human activity.  Cars driving on the street waaaaaay off in the distance set it off.<br>-LAG.  The time between when someone comes to the door/rings the bell and when you get a notice is soooo long.  As mentioned above, since I didn't have a hardwired chime in the home, I went ahead and splurged on the $30 chime peripheral that allows this thing to act like an actual doorbell.  That lag also impacted how long it took the chime to sound.<br>-Annual cost - I'm sure you'll see plenty of people mention this, but yes. In addition to the initial outlay, you also need to pay an annual fee to ""keep"" your videos.  It's not the worst, it's not the best.  The cost was worth it to me to get that one FedEx guy in trouble but *shrug*.<br>-Doesn't work with all smarthome ecosystems.  When I initially researched this, it was supposed to be able to work with Google Home. Amazon bought Ring. Guess what happened.<br>-and here's the big one: it. stopped. working.<br>All of the sudden, apparently, this thing bricked itself.  I didn't get any kind of notification or anything. I just realized one day that I hadn't gotten any ""false alarm"" motion notifications in a while, and when I looked, my doorbell was offline.  I followed all the troubleshooting and even turned power off and on at the breaker, which basically confirmed something wrong with the device (because it powered up for a second and then went kaput again).  After too long a call with the customer service people (who made me do all the same stuff AGAIN, despite me telling them I had already done them), they said ""oh, we'll send you a new one!""...<br>...except then they told me they would charge me for the new one if I didn't return the old one in 30 days.  And when I asked if they were sending a tech to uninstall the device hardwired into my home and install the replacement, they said no.  I am neither confident enough nor qualified to install something like this (I did my thermostat, but that's much more straightforward), and I already paid for installation once.  And if I couldn't get it swapped out in a month, I'd be charged for a new one again? And this one isn't really that great? Nah. I just ordered a Nest Hello instead.  Yes, I'll still have to pay someone to install it, and yes, they also have a subscription service, but it's compatible with my other smart home devices so there's that.<br><br>I hope this helps someone out there.  Good luck, y'all.

  Installed the Ring Pro a few weeks ago. First thing first, the package provides everything you need to install minus some basic tools like a drill and hammer if you need the included hollow wall plugs.<br><br>This was installed on stucco. I would suggest buying the Ring Chime Pro with this product in case you need to extend your WiFi to connect as I had trouble getting the Ring Pro connected. You can always return it if not needed. Or setup a WiFi mesh network like Google WiFi to ensure a strong signal. Stucco will block your signals. A quick chat with Ring support helped me to figure out this problem.<br><br>One giant issue: if you run into the WiFi connectivity issues AFTER physically installing your Ring Pro in it's final location (and hooking up the controller in the chime box and wired up the Ring Pro at the old push button location,) and are unable to complete the App setup, the Ring Pro will not operate your existing chime in the meantime. So I was forced to re-install the push button, re-establish the connections in the chime and place the Ring Pro aside while I waited for the Chime Pro to arrive. In a few days, I plugged the newly arrived Chime Pro in an outlet inside the front entry, re-installed the physical components at the chime and finally the Ring Pro. In the app, installed the Chime Pro and connected to my WiFi then connected the Ring Pro to the Chime Pro. Success! But...<br><br>The Ring support FAQ's indicated that the Ring Pro will work with our NuTone BK125LWH-1 mechanical chime. Not so fast. We have a single chime, single push button setup; basic. After solving the initial setup issue, I noticed existing chime now doesn't chime once the Ring Pro button is pressed. To compound the issue, a day later the Ring Pro stopped working too. This time you'll have to knock! Wasn't going to uninstall all the physical components.  Discovered the Ring Pro and chime setup had burned out the existing transformer. Bought and replaced with a like kind NuTone transformer. Two days later, same result. The Ring FAQs and support mentions nothing of the transformer issues with NuTone/Braun chimes. I suspected that I needed a transformer that had the amperage to handle a two chime, single button setup. So I ordered the NuTone C907 16V, 30VA Transformer; a 15a step up. Again  a few days later received and installed. Success again!!!<br><br>After more than a week, all is working.

  I am on my second Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  The first one was defective and I returned it after receiving a replacement from Amazon--the Amazon support staff is excellent--I replaced the Ring with the new one. It worked for two days and then quit.  I had surgery on the day it quit and did not realize there was a problem until I returned home from the hospital.  The Ring app suggests there is a problem with something and after reading all of the troubleshooting material from Ring--the last suggestion after eliminating all of the potential issues was a 'power supply' problem.  I spent $85 for my electrician to replace the transformer on the furnace prior to installing the Ring since I knew that my transformer was insufficient.  My electrician also double checked to may sure all of my wiring was properly installed on the bell and on the Ring itself.  It was.  Thus, I am at a loss to figure out what is the problem other than the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is a fickle unreliable product.<br>Update 02/15/18<br>On 9 Jan the Ring Pro failed causing the transformer and the bell to cease operation. I was in the hospital following major surgery when my wife texted me at about Midnight that something had happened.  Apparently, when the Ring Pro 2 failed, it set off my thermostat which controls the furnace.  Since I was recovering from surgery, I was not able to adequately troubleshoot what happened until 2 weeks later when I had my electrician return and try to trace what had happened. We replaced the transformer again and checked all the wiring along with purchasing a new doorbell.  Installed all of them. Even called Ring Tech Support, that sent us a new electrical harness kit--installed all of that stuff a couple of days ago.  Unfortunately, the Ring Pro still does not function. So, buyer beware. The Ring pro 2 has serious issues. All told, I've spent about $600.00 trying to get the Ring Pro 2 to work.  Alas, a huge waste of money.

  I had purchased this doorbell in May and install and setup was easy. We paid for the subscription to store the video. The button developed a large crack so I requested a replacement button. They can’t replace just the button, so they sent me a replacement device. The new device installed and setup just as well as the first, but within about a week I had problems with the device going offline. Reset the device using the troubleshooting guide and restored connection. Less than a week later the unit lost power. I called customer service and they said it was an easy fix, that the device needed a firmware upgrade. They would restore the firmware on their end and then get me going. Well that didn’t work so they had me disconnect the device for 2 minutes, but when I reconnected the device it still wouldn’t power on. They had me open the chime device to ensure it was compatible, which it was. Then they had me search my house for a transistor, which I found and told them the resistor was 18v and 10VA. They said that my transistor was the culprit behind the device failing to power on, even though I had power at the doorbell wiring, and even though my first device remained powered on with zero issues for about 4-5 months. The resistor needs to be at least 30 VA (duh)!  They told me I’ll have to replace the resistor, which could conveniently be purchased from them (Amazon), or upgrade to their $499 doorbell. I asked them if it would work with the 10VA resistor and the guy said no, it gets power from an Ethernet cable. So I would then have to run Ethernet to my doorbell to get the $500 doorbell to work. Absolutely disappointed because I love the doorbell when it works, but right now this thing is useless.

  Purchased this because I recently had a package stolen from my porch.  I got it and set it up no problems, until it came time to connect to my Wifi. I have two different Wifi Networks in my home, a Comcast Business Internet Wifi/Router and multiple Apple Airport Extreme routers bound as a single network.  My Wifi is rock solid and works perfectly in all other situations except for the Ring Doorbell Cam.  It would connect for about a minute and then disconnect, it behaved this way on either of my networks.  I spent over 1/2 an hour with the Tech person at Ring and nothing. There is either something wrong physically with the unit i received or the system is junk, either way I'm sending it back.

  I was originally disappointed, as the first unit I received was defective. It installed quickly, powered on, but then would not create a wifi network as it is supposed to in order to allow initial setup. After a quick call to Ring customer support determined it was defective, I got in touch with Amazon, and they overnighted me a replacement. I will say, despite the frustration of getting a bad unit and getting almost completely through installation before having to stop, I was thoroughly impressed with Ring customer support. When I called, I was able to speak to an actual human in under 10 seconds (a rarity today). Not only did he try to help me fix the device, but after determining it was defective and instructing me to contact Amazon to have it replaced, it wasn't 30 seconds after we hung up that I had an e-mail from the rep letting me know that if Amazon wasn't able to immediately replace it, and if they weren't able to offer me free overnight shipping for the replacement to get it to me as quickly as possible, just to call or e-mail him back directly and he would ensure it was taken care of on the Ring end of things. Literally could not have asked for that situation to have been handled better.<br><br>Now, after installing the new unit, I was thoroughly impressed with it. I currently have a 1080P security camera mounted above my front door. The Ring Pro has a very noticeably clearer picture than my other camera (so much so, that I am now replacing that camera with one of the Ring Stick Up cams).<br><br>Installation was simple and easy (took less than 15 minutes).<br><br>Before my purchase, I read through a lot of the reviews and seen a few consistent complaints, so I figured I'd address them based on my experience. From what I can tell, it appears they have all been resolved.<br><br>1) Wifi connectivity issues - I seen several complaints that it would randomly disconnect from wifi without notice. My Pro is reading a constant ""Good"" wifi signal, and has not disconnected once.<br><br>2) Delay in recording once motion is detected - I genuinely couldn't ask for this thing to pickup motion any faster. For example, when I go to walk out my front door, before my foot can touch my porch, my phone is vibrating to let me know motion was detected. In fact, last night I got a notification that motion was detected while watching TV. Pulled up my phone and played the recording, and it literally started as a cricket was in mid-air jumping onto one of the stones on the siding of my house. Not really sure you could ask for more than that.<br><br>3) Delay in doorbell chime inside the house after button is pressed - So, a few people mentioned that someone would hit the doorbell button, their phone would go off, but it would take 5-15 seconds before their chime actually rang out in the house. I have a standard hardwired digital chime in my house. I will say there is a very slight delay (half second to one second), but it is so short it is almost unnoticeable (the only reason I noticed it was because since I'd seen the complaints, I specifically wanted to test for it). Had I not have been actually looking for the delay, I wouldn't have even noticed it.<br><br>4) Price plan for multiple cameras - So, ring offers their cloud service (which you have to have in order to save your recordings) for $3/mo or $30/yr per camera. There was one or two people who were upset that a discount wasn't offered for those owning multiple cameras (if you've got a big house and purchase 10 cameras, after all, that adds up). I am happy to say that Ring has added a second plan that is $10/mo or $100/yr for unlimited cameras. So, if  you've got 3 or less, stick with the per-camera plan. Otherwise, definitely switch to the unlimited. After calling customer support to ask, if you currently have 3 cameras, have paid your $30 each for the year, and add a fourth, you can either call or go online to convert your plan to the unlimited. They'll issue a credit for any remaining time you had, so the most you'll ever pay is $100/yr (if you do the annual plan instead of monthly). They also give you a 30 day free trial so you can check it out before you decide whether to sign up for the plan or not.<br><br>So, my only complaint thus far about the Pro is that the angled mounting bracket is not included, and must be purchased separately. In my opinion, this should be a standard part of the installation kit. Most people probably won't need it. That said, my doorbell is located directly next to a stone wall. As a result, without that bracket to tilt the doorbell away from the wall, 50% of my picture is just the wall. To make matters worse, this causes period issues where the camera will focus on one of the stones instead of the walkway, so someone walking up is *slightly* blurry, and at night, the IR lights shine on the stones and wash out the remainder of the picture. You can still see a person walking up at night, but you can't see them until they get right up to the door. The bracket is cheap, and should solve the problem entirely, it's just annoying to have to purchase it separately. In the grand scheme of things, though, not really a big deal, and certainly not worth knocking off stars. I'd just suggest that if you think you may need it, go ahead and order it. Worst case scenario, you can always return the bracket if you don't need it, but it's a lot easier to set everything up once and be done than to have to take it down, add the bracket, and remount it.<br><br>TL;DR - Amazing product, even better customer support, and previous issues have been fixed/addressed. Definitely recommend. Will definitely be purchasing other Ring products in the near future.

  What a great idea. Unfortunately execution of the product leaves much to be desired. Audio from outside at the doorbell to an inside device like a cell phone or iPad is terrible. No amount fiddling around with it, as recommended by Ring customer service, could improve performance. Even a signal booster (repeater) sold by Ring and touted to make everything all right was a waste of money and time. It did not make things all right. It did not even improve function one iota. Ring customer care continued to encourage me to buy a new router or other device to boost the signal. I asked them to send me one and I would try it. They declined. I am not about to spend another$300+ on more equipment that may or may not work. It's funny how all other Wi-Fi equipment works perfectly through my Verizon FIOS router. But not this Ring door bell device! I sent it all back to Ring and to Amazon today. My advice: save your money. There are a lot of better video devices that are way better for security and less intrusive. Too bad I didn't know this beforehand, or maybe that I was too pig-headed to listen to others and their reviews. You have been warned... Caveat Emptor!

  Not compatible with DC powered doorbells. Put that on the box and the online description please, so you don't waste people's time and $.  Support has to send you a bypass, which isn't an option for mine since there's no separate transformer.  Their solution is to downgrade you to a battery powered non-pro unit.<br><br>I believe Ring is in violation of product standards, as you have to list compatibility requirements on the product.

  After 3 days of attempting to get this to work with my existing door chime, and spending over a hundred dollars at the advice of the Ring company, I'm returning this video doorbell.  I hired a professional installer that Ring scheduled come to my home today and he could not get everything to work together.  First, I contacted Ring for assistance &amp; they told me to replace the doorbell transformer which I did and then the installer told me that was not necessary?  Second, they told me my door chime in the house was not on the phantom ""approved list"" of door chimes which they then emailed to me. So I spent another fifty dollars to replace the door chime unit which, again, the installer said was not the problem.  The installer got it to ring once, with the help of their phone service, and said ""It's fixed, and we thought it was.  But after he left, I pressed the door bell button and the chime would not stop ringing.  It rang for a good 15 minutes, then I disconnected the wire to the chime in the house.  After that, the camera would not come on any longer.  So I packed it up and it's going back UPS Monday.<br><br>All the aggravation and time spent installing and un-installing and changing wires, and changing units ended up only costing me about sixty dollars to wind up back where I started with just a plain doorbell!<br><br>Beware, there are a lot of kinks in this system and nobody knows how to fix them.  It pretty much will work or it will not and there's no fixing it if it will not.

  I am on my second Ring Pro doorbell from Amazon.  I had Amazon replace my first one when it began getting stuck in night-vision mode after the second or third day of use.  My replacement doorbell is now doing exactly the same thing after the second day of use.  Ring's support team hasn't been very helpful at all, as they simply told me to perform a factory reset on the device which of course takes it back to daytime mode UNTIL the next dark-to-day cycle occurs.<br><br>A quick search on Google shows that I am not the only one with this problem.

  I bought this device in May 2017. I loved it. It worked perfectly. The quality of the video was crisp and clear, the motion detection was the perfect amount of sensitivity, and as long as the porch light was on, the night videos were also in color. But then after 8/11/17, I stopped receiving motion notifications. I didn't notice it until Monday when I went to work and realized that I received no notice that someone was at the front door - e.g., me when I left for work.  The doorbell, when activated, started video recording, but motion was not detected at all.<br><br>So I called ring customer service on Monday 8/14/17 and he provided excellent customer service.  He verified that all motion stopped being detected as of 8/12/17. Motion started getting detected again as of mid-evening on 8/14/17 but he said, I did nothing on my side to correct the problem; it looks like it self corrected.<br><br>Throughout the week, from Monday 8/14/17 to today 8/17/17, I noticed the following problems.<br>1. Lower quality video.  The images weren't as sharp but grainy at times. It was not 1080p quality.<br>2. Sometimes the video became black and white during the day when the sun is out. It's supposed to be color.<br>3. All videos at night were now black and white even though the porch light was still on and nothing had changed on my part. Before 8/12/17, night videos with the porch light were in color.<br>4. The device was slow to detect motion like someone walking in front of the device. The videos started recording after there was one second of motion where before this weekend, the video recording included one second before observable motion.<br>5. The device recorded and sent me notifications that it had detected motion but when I viewed the video, there was no observable motion.<br><br>I called customer service again today 8/17/17. The first lady I talk to says all of these problems are not problems and it's normal.  When I explain to her that there is substantial difference from before this weekend to now, she is evasive.  She does say there was a firmware update this past weekend and that the update is supposed to improve the device's functioning.<br><br>I call back and talk to another person hoping that he will be more reasonable and not say that all these problems are normal and/or improvements.  He explains that there was a recent firmware update and that he too has been having the same problems with his ring device and that these problems should get fixed.<br><br>This reminds me of smart phone updates and the phones getting glitchy. I really hope they fix these problems soon.<br><br>A few months back, their server was down for a few hours so no one was getting notifications making the device essentially non functional.  I understand that all technology is not perfect and there will be glitches along the way but I hope ring sees these as problems like the last customer service rep rather than the female rep who said these problems are normal.

  The Ring Doorbell and other Ring devices work well enough, although they are often very slow to connect when you want to answer the doorbell or see what caused an alert. My big problem is the total lack of customer service.  The website is difficult to use and you cannot speak or chat with a CSR.  I have several times waited more than 30 minutes and given up.  If you send an email, it takes 5-7 days for a response and the response does not make any sense.  I was trying to replace one device with a new one and the telephone app would not let me.  When I finally got a response, I was told I had to do it on a desktop using only the Safari browser. (That  didn't work either.)  Recently I have been trying to renew the subscription plan for one device, but the website is trying force me to pay for 2, even though the other device is paid in advance for a year. The devices work, but be prepared for frustration if you have any issues.

  I've had an original Ring Doorbell since January 2016, and while it has its flaws, I was mostly happy with it. When I saw the ""new"" Ring Pro, released three months after my original purchase, I was interested. But Ring.com has a ""no upgrade"" policy. No loyalty discounts, no bonus offers, nothing. You buy a completely new device as if you were a new customer. I don't like that, but I guess I can understand their policy... they're probably still a smallish niche company, needing to stretch their revenue as much as possible. Yea.<br><br>Fast forward to Prime Day 2017 when the Ring Pro was one of the deals. At least I could fool myself into thinking I got a discount. Prime delivery was fast, but installation was a bit more tricky on the Pro. I don't understand the ""pro power kit"" which is apparently necessary, but easy enough to install. The doorbell mounting was tricky, as I needed a ""retrofit"" plate to cover the existing holes, and the wires for the doorbell itself were short with not much room for play. But either way, still something an average DIY homeowner can do in an hour.<br><br>As with the original Ring, hardware and packaging was fantastic, but software falls short. I needed to run thru Wifi set up twice for some reason. The first time it worked, and when I pressed the doorbell button, my phone immediately notified me MUCH faster than the original. Second time I pressed the doorbell button, the blue ring spun around in circles and never notified my phone, and no events were logged. It stayed spinning blue for an hour, at which point I did a hard-reset and re-ran the setup process, and then it started to behave as expected.<br><br>But there is a really weird 5 or so second lag on the MECHANICAL DOORBELL ITSELF. When I press the Ring button, my phone is notified, and THEN a few seconds later my mechanical chime rings.That lag was consistent. I figured something went wrong again, so I again did a hard-reset but the lag was still there.<br><br>Pondering this issue, I had my hand resting on the Ring Pro and it was noticeably, and uncomfortably, warm. Not hot, but warmer than I think it should be. Since physical installation was kinda tricky, I didn't really want to dismount the Ring Pro and fiddle with it to make sure nothing was crossed. Eventually settled on removing Ring Pro and putting the original back.<br><br>This is all too bad, because when it did work, it was very fast to notify, ring views were nice and sharp, and I loved the idea of the motion zones, even if I didn't get to play with them...

  I really wanted to like this product, but could not get it to power up.  Inconsistent instructions from Ring. Application Guides posted on Amazon states ""you'll need to replace your existing doorbell's transformer with the provided 24VAC transformer"".  However, same application guide mentions 230VAC input power so it appears that this guide is for Europe, but same guide gives a US phone number for help from Ring. Ring web site states that a 16-24VAC transformer is required. No mention of VA.  However, the help section of the web site says ""Your Ring Pro requires a power source that supplies a minimum of 16 volts AC at ~20 volt-amps when connected directly to a transformer or plug-in adapter, or ~30 volt-amps when used with an internal doorbell"".  I tried installing with my existing 16V - 10VA transformer but the Ring Pro never powered up.  I then purchased a 16V - 20VA transformer but found no improvement. I even tried a 20V 30VA transformer.  I called Ring who said 16V - 10VA transformer is all that is needed and if it did not power up then Pro is defective.  Since I bought the Pro on sale at Amazon, I am not allowed to exchange it.  I can only get a refund and re-purchase it at higher price.  Due to inconsistent information from Ring and the price increase, I am out of the market now.

  Installed about 4 months ago. After reading other reviews, I verified first that the existing transformer was 16V. Following the videos and instructions, I had no trouble installing. I was a tiny bit disappointed that the unit did not recognize my 5GHz network, but I installed it on the 2.7GHz.  It came up no problem. I customized the range, the schedule of alarms and motion detection with no problem.<br>However, recently, we had both a power outage and two mild earthquakes, and for whatever reason, the Ring Pro quit working. I didn't know if I had a electrical problem or a network problem. Before I tore into tracing power hookups, etc., I called Ring Customer Service and talked to Joyann.  With her on the line, she walked me through checking if the unit had power to it, recycling power at the circuit box, etc. In about ten minutes she concluded the Ring had gone belly up for some reason, and ordered a new unit to be sent.  I was told it would be 5-7 days, but I received it in 2 days.  I am awaiting the separately sent power unit harness to reinstall to original effectiveness. Hats off to Ring and Joyann for standing behind their product.

The unit I bought was bad and that was the reason I was not able to get it working.

I cant write a complete review at this point because I have not been able to get it to power up. Customer service from ring so far has been meh.<br><br>I have gone through two new transformers and still will not completely power up. Do not just look at your doorbell system and assume that if the chime states it’s a 16 volt system that you are actually getting that. Seriously put a meter on the connection at the door to see what you are getting. My original transformer was a 16v/10a one but only was getting 11v at the door as well as the at the TF. Enter TF number two...16v/10a now putting out 20v (lol) even at the door. Now I started getting a flicker at the Ring unit but still will not ring the chime or power up. Thought maybe it was an amp issue. Enter TF number three at 16v/30a and the exact same results so far.<br><br>Again, customer service has been meh and not really helpful. Going to buy another one locally and see if I have a defective unit...wish me luck.<br><br>Stay tuned and be warned!

  will not work. spent 3 hours on chat-support (Ring) and they have every excuse that it is my house...1) they said I had in my Pro kit a diode.  No, I did not receive a diode in my retail Pro Ring Doorbell kit (ordered here).  The Ring2 kit has a diode.  The paperwork also doesn't it includes a diode.  Ring swears I had one in my kit.  Then they blamed my electronic door chime.  Then they blamed my transformer.  Then they blamed my wiring.  15 feet from transformer to chime.  16 feet from chime to doorbell actual.  With a multi-meter I checked the 120V line to the transformer (just fine) and then the line to the chime (just fine) and finally the line to the doorbell (just fine)...The setup would not work at all when the V was stepped down to 16V (which was how my chime was setup as well)...so I instructed to try the 24V 20VA....and it worked for 1 complete cycle of pushing the button and making my chime work AND the app notify me.....then it died.  Support said the Ring said it was underpowered (sound familiar people)....and youtube is full of the same issue, and its never been the house...so I am not going to install new transformer, nor a new chime, nor wiring just to have a wired video doorbell!

  We really liked the Ring Doorbell Pro for about 2- 3 weeks.  Video was a little slow and voice really didn't work at all, but it was fun and new, and we forgave the doorbell's flaws.  But then, at some point, the doorbell chimes in our home stopped working - meaning we have no idea when someone is ringing our door until we receive a notification on our cell phone.  So we usually get to the door just in time to see our visitors and contractors getting in their cars or walking away.<br><br>Ring Support suggested we upgrade our doorbell transformer.  Support seemed very confident, so we purchased and installed a new 16V/30VAC doorbell transformer ($29) from Ring.  Doorbells still don't ring.  Not at all.  Now Ring Support suggests we try the Ring Chime Pro Kit repeater ($49) because my WiFi signal seems a little weak.  OK.  My router is less than 10 feet away from the doorbell and tests out to be very fast.  Also, seems very odd that my hard-wired door bell chime would stop working because of a weak WiFi signal.<br><br>So we tested the WiFi signal by the doorbell and it's super!  But we tested the signal from the Ring App's device health check and... signal is weak.  Now, the app recommends we purchase the Chime Kit Pro repeater ($49).  But I've already got a $250 doorbell that doesn't work, so why not throw another $49 at the problem?  I just ordered the Chime Kit Pro on Amazon and will update this review with results.<br><br>As of now, we don't have a working doorbell.  My neighbor re-installed his old doorbell next to Ring.  But two doorbells is just too confusing.  I never know which doorbell to push.  So I knock.  It's just that he just could not bring himself to throw his Ring away.  Neither can I.  Maybe Ring will send an update that fixes the doorbell.  Maybe...<br><br>Anyway, the Ring Doorbell is it's just too expensive not to work reliably as, well, as a doorbell.

  Worked great for 18 months. The product is defective in design. Though wired to your door bell it still has an internal battery that cannot be replaced.

  As background, we have very fast internet access.<br><br>When ring works, it's great, but far too often, it is so slow as to be useless. We find that when someone comes to our door, we often cannot get an image before they are already walking away. In other words, we cannot get the information in time to make a decision as to whether to answer the door or not.<br><br>This is an artifact of their architecture in that the camera links to ring infrastructure, and then sends the image/sound to your mobile app. That means that performance is bound by the responsiveness of both the internet (not a problem in our case), and more critically, rings infrastructure. This issue appears to be getting worse over time. Their infrastructure may be choking on ring's success. I suspect many, many holiday shoppers for ring will be frustrated in even trying to get new installations to connect and register.

  In the end I give this 4 stars.<br>I have deducted one star from an otherwise correctly working product mainly due to the installation issue I had.<br><br>First things first: Now it is working fine. I have no issues at all with it. The notifications come through quickly. Motion is detected properly. The current firmware version of my Doorbell Pro is 1.1.30. Also note that my home internet connection is quite good (50 Mbit/s down; 5 Mbit/s up; Comcast cable). My wireless router (latest version Apple Airport Extreme) is about 10 feet away from the Ring Doorbell Pro right on the other side of the front door.<br><br>Back to the installation issue: As instructed I connected the Pro Power Kit to the existing doorbell. I replaced the existing doorbell button with the Ring Doorbell Pro. I finished the setup through the app on my phone. Everything seemed to work fine.<br><br>Only one major issue: Every night around 10 PM the doorbell would stop responding. Completely dead. The only way to get it to work again was to either reset the Ring Doorbell Pro (which is hard; take off the cover; hold the button on the side) or power cycle the doorbell transformer.<br>I contacted Ring support and they sent me on a wild goose chase. Reset the doorbell (I already did that). Check internet connection (connection is fine; that is clearly not the problem here). No help from Ring support.<br><br>After I couple of days of resetting the doorbell every morning I wondered why it was failing every evening. Then it dawned on me: At some point in the evening it will switch on its IR LEDs which cause it to use more power! I checked my current transformer (Broan Nutone 515T) and that was only rated 10 V; 5 VA. Not enough to power the Ring Doorbell Pro. I replaced it with a generic 16 V; 10 VA transformer and have had no issues since.<br><br>I should have realized this sooner. Using the old transformer the mechanical doorbell would only ""ding"" when pressing the Ring Doorbell Pro. With the new transformer it is doing the proper ""ding-dong"" sound.

  This is sort of maybe okay for some people, but I would not buy it again. The integration with Alexa works very poorly. I have five echos that are supposed to chime when someone rings the doorbell, but none do. Viewing the doorbell video on an Echo Show rarely works, and when it does it takes a good 45 seconds before you can see the video. It does, however, ring our regular doorbell downstairs, so it's ... okay.<br><br>It does, however, work for recording video when someone comes to the door, although 90% of the recordings are of reflections from car lights driving by. I bought this because we have a Ring security system (which strangely is excellent) and a lot of Alexas, but the integrations do not work, either well or often at all.<br><br>However, if you just want a video doorbell that records what's going on, it works well for that.

  First, make sure you have the right voltage for your doorbell. If you don't, as I did, the doorbell will have a series of frustrating problems from not connecting to your wifi to turning off randomly, etc. Tech support was super helpful and identified the issue quickly: my old doorbell used a 10V transformer, they recommend 16-24v. This was easy to change out once I found where the transformer was. No similar issues since.<br><br>Other than that, the basic functionality has worked well: it looks nice (I like the subtle glow of the ring around the button at night), is a nice form factor for replacing an old doorbell, and when the button is pressed it connects to your phone pretty fast in our experience so far. I also like that it works with my Wink hub, allowing, for instance, using alerts of various kinds to trigger Wink robots.<br><br>The motion alerts have required the most tweaking so far. You can create zones to monitor and set the sensitivity. It's been a trial and error process to find a setup that minimizes false alarms while notifying us reliably when something of interest occurs: we initially had the default sensitivity but placed the zone only over our yard and not the road. This created a lot of false alarms, e.g. when headlights sweep across our yard at night. Turning down the sensitivity meant we missed some alerts like mailmen walking up. We now have as just a zone covering the whole view but at its lowest sensitivity (labeled ""people only"") and it has seemed reliable so far (though its obviously hard to know what you missed -- it catches us every time at least). It would be nice to control the sensitivity of each zone separately, I think this would catch some of the edge cases.<br><br>Regardless, we've already captured one attempted mail thief on camera. The videos are easy to download and share, and you are invited to join other ring users in your area in a neighborhood group to share videos.

  I bought the Ring Pro a couple years ago. The doorbell worked well for a few months, then we started having issues with live answering. Recording still works, but when I actually try to answer the doorbell all I get is an ""Activating Device"" loading screen. This has been extremely frustrating for my wife and I. We upgraded our wireless router and upped our internet speed (upload speed now at 6 mbps). Ring support walked me through several other troubleshooting steps, but even with the device in ""perfect health"" nothing resolved my issues. Ring sent a replacement device but it did not change the problem. After researching the problem for a bit, it seems to be a widespread issue. At this point we cannot answer the door while away, which pretty much defeats the purpose of having the device. While recording still works, Ring charges monthly/annually for this service.<br><br>I'd highly recommend staying away from Ring products. My friends have had similar issues with Ring and made the switch to Nest Cams, which they are very happy with.

   I've had a lot of frustration with this product and was considering returning it. It required a lot of troubleshooting after installation based on what was within its view. I suspect the original firmware had problems with audio/video quality that was fixed with a factory reset and registration as a new doorbell. A WiFi router sets about five feet behind the doorbell. Motion detection was triggered at sunrise every day, waking my dog and I up, and I was faced with a puppy who wanted to interact with me an hour before my alarm went off.

  The Hate: Okay, to say the least setup was an adventure and it may not be over. Installing this gadget is a major pain. I installed the pro (no battery) and followed the directions to a tee. I bypassed the existing 12 volt doorbell, used an existing 24 vac 40 va transformer, checked the voltage at the door, 24 volts as expected, hooked the device up, and, and, and, NOTHING. Okay, bought another recommended transformer and tried it on a workbench with a 10 inch wire connection, and, and, and NOTHING. No lights, no nothing. Talked to support and they said sometimes there's a delay (?), so let it sit with power for at least an hour, and, and, and NOTHING.  Called support back and they agreed to an RMA. While waiting for the new unit, I pulled the device out of the closet and tried it on the workbench again and it worked! Hooked it up to the door wiring, and it worked! I've never seen a device without a battery act like this.  Some people on the forums say they had to wait 12 hours for the initial power-up. No wifi connection or streaming problems using the 5 GHz channel on a  DLink router.<br><br>The Love:  Once working, it had an excellent picture, even at night. Motion zones can be set to block the street traffic and motion detection works fairly well with adjustable sensitivity. App allows for neighborhood alerts which is great. Cloud storage plan costs $30 a year, and that's reasonable. Support is decent.<br><br>In summay, setup/installation is horrible, operation is pretty good, and support (which you WILL need) is okay.  Have it connected to an Echo Show as well as my phone, and the camera view is good and takes about 5 seconds to connect, but  really the doorbell should ring on the Echo and automatically display.  Come on Ring, Nest is breathing down your neck - get the Echo app right.  Since my old doorbell had to be bypassed due to low voltage (&lt;16 volts ac)  they sent a wifi chime that plugs in separately.  It failed almost immediately. and I'm waiting on a replacement (quality control issues?).<br><br>I got it on sale and I still think it's too expensive, but when it works it's great, except for the Amazon Echo skill. But, will it continue to work, and will Ring be there to support it after Nest and the clones zero in on this market?  Fingers crossed.

  Adding to my initial review:  Installed the Ring doorbell and it worked for about six months.  When I go into my Ring app, it shows the latest motion but as I'm on a MacBook Pro, I can't get it to page down to see anything past five or so motion occurrences.  The ring sensor seems to have stopped working as I've had people waiting on my doorstep after pressing the button  (twice) and nothing happens.<br>Old review:  I was able to install it only after looking on youtube for videos.  It does require a bit of wiring but everything is provided in the packaging.  I was not able to flip the breaker to the doorbell so was a little hesitant when I was connecting things together but did not get shocked - just kept the wires apart and I was fine.  I needed to ring the doorbell a few times and walk in front of the motion detection before it started registering.  They give you 30 days free of recording and then you need to pay $30/year to keep recording to the iCloud which I think is a good deal and idea.  I've gotten a few false (?) motion detector alarms.  Not sure if they're false - just nothing shows up (it somewhat freezes) when I click on it after it notifies me.  I also have found that the motion detector only works about 40% of the time.  I'm quite happy with the video quality just hoping it's maybe a bit more reliable with showing me why it's notifying me of motion.  Better than nothing and somewhat inexpensive for what you get - cameras without taking apart drywall, installing a bunch of electrical and video wires???

  Before you purchase this item, here are a few things to know.  Even if you have a wired doorbell, your doorbell transformer might not be strong enough.  My Ring worked for 10 days and then froze.  I had been an Amazon installer to install the product to ensure it was done correctly.  The technician returned and got me a new doorbell transformer.  When that did not work, I was told to buy a Ring Internet extender which I did.  It did not work.  The technician returned and tried for 3 hours to correct the problem before calling the overseas Ring technician.  We still could not get the bell to work so I asked for an exchange.  The ensuing process was maddening.  I was told to photograph the wiring in my doorbell which I did after my technician left.  Then I was told to take a picture of the bell transformer.  It was located on top of a light bulb near the top of my 9 foot ceiling.  I complied.  Two days passed with no response from Ring.  I emailed to ask if my photos had come through.  Finally, someone connected with me and asked for more information, never acknowledging that they had reviewed the materials that I had submitted.  This continued for two weeks before I gave up.  I will NEVER purchase an item from this company again.

If I’m at home, I can answer a ring and see video. But as soon as I try to add sound, the video freezes and a few seconds later just goes to black. So I’m dropping from 2 to 1 star.

This is true on LTE with good bandwidth. On the local wifi with the doorbell, it doesn't work any better. I had to replace one of my Rings with an Arlo because after 2 years it decided to stop working on my wifi. I bought a new unit, and it wouldn't connect either.

  The expectation of being able to quickly respond to movement/activity at the front door is a myth. With the ring app quickly viewing and reacting to that activity just doesn't occur. When there is activity I get an immediate notice on my phone about it. I should be able to view and quickly respond (like their videos imply) but the ring app and integration with their servers is like molasses. The ring app shows the event but when you try to quickly (HA) view it there is no response and trying to initiate a Live View won't run either. I takes more than a minute before either can be accomplished. That Amazon package thief will be in the next state by the time you can respond. Of course, the problem is my Wi-Fi. That's<br>Ring's universal catchall answer to all problems. Even though I have a new powerful router mesh setup with lots of connections including 2 other cameras running Spy4 (never misses a beat), Ring experiences problems. I've talked to their various support people and gone thru numerous Wi-Fi resets<br>that all include having to strip the cover off the doorbell and press a button (what's up with THAT!).  The one thing that DOES seem to work is that pop-up AD that frequently reminds you that your trial ends in “X” days so send money now. When it pops up it pauses the app until you dismiss it. I bought a<br>Ring floodlight camera too but have delayed putting it up. I don't think that I'll send in my $30 bucks for something that is not reliable. I suspect that Ring has gotten too big too quickly for their infrastructure to keep up. Don't expect to be viewing and talking to intruders in real time like all their promotional hype depicts.<br><br>I had 3 stars but am changing to 2 stars. The ring now app reuses to do a live view when I am on my phone LTE. I mainly bought this system because I work nights and wanted to check up on things.

  Great buy! It’s easily accessible through the phone and is very convenient to use! You can easily see who is at your doorstep once someone rings the bell. The only drawback to this item was that it may not be compatible with the current doorbell wiring at your house. I was on the verge of returning this product. However, after doing a lot of research, I came across the ELK TRG2440 24VAC, 40 VA AC Transformer with PTC fuse and it did the trick with getting this installed.

  im a little on the fence between 3 stars and 4 stars.  overall i want to give this 5 stars.  its wired, no battery, but has draw backs.  this is my 2nd ring doorbell.  i had the first ring doorbell that came out that had a battery, then i decided to upgrade to the pro which was power only.  with this particular doorbell, i had to upgrade my doorbell transformer to a 24v transformer.  which a standard system is approximately 16v.  most transformers you purchase at your local home depot or lowes only sell 16v.  for some reason, 16v was not enough power for the doorbell to operate.  the ring app stated not enough power.  so after finding a 24v transformer at an ace hardware store, i installed it and it worked great.  after a few months, i started having issues with connectivity and the motion detection.  ring walked me through all the steps and found that the doorbell unit was defective and was over heating.  so they sent me a replacement, no questions asked.  ring customer support is by far the best.  talking with people that actually care is very hard to find.  so after i installed the replacement, the replacement unit worked fine.  but after about 3-4 months later, i found myself in the same situation with the motion not working right.  i would receive a motion notification way after someone has came to my door and left.  so it was kinda defeating the purpose of motion detection.  i played with the sensitivity, and i wasn't getting anywhere.  i called ring and basically had to re-program it.  after re-programming it, it seemed to work fine.  then a few months later, i started getting motion from everything.  a leaf, a fly, the most ridiculous things were setting off my motion.  i even adjusted the zone so it wasn't close to the side walk and it was still picking up people walking by.  i also noticed that when the sun was shining on the doorbell, it wasn't as accurate.  my house faces the west.  so i have had multiple issues with this doorbell.  when it works correctly, its awesome.  when i got motion, it was extremely accurate.  i would open the app and it would pop right up.  when it decides to not work properly, its almost no point in even having a video doorbell.  motion was all over the place, doorbell took forever to chime.  sometimes no alert on my phone or apple watch or tablet.  so overall, i give this unit 3 stars.  work the bugs and it would be an easy 5 stars.  customer service is amazing.  but having to call over and over gets annoying.

  I purchased the Ring Video Doorbell Pro and a Chime Pro in late 2018. I have now had it more than a year and I don't think it has worked properly for more than five days at a time. I live in an urban area and although I have ridiculously fast wifi (400 Mbps) and an Eero mesh system to boost the signal from the router, the doorbell constantly disconnects from the chime. All I hear when someone rings the bell is my old mechanical doorbell, which I was smart enough not to disconnect when I installed this. Ring has now sent me a replacement doorbell and two replacement Chime Pros, and they still can't get it to stay connected. Even when the app tells me that everything is online, when someone rings the doorbell it doesn't connect to the chime inside the house. I have spent at least a dozen hours on the phone with them and they have tried several different ""solutions,"" but within a day or two it's back to not working.<br><br>I have had to take the screws off the front plate so many times to push the button that starts the connection process so many times that it started to fall apart and I needed to use duct tape to keep it on the front of the house.<br><br>In addition, the motion detector is garbage. I live, like I said, in a busy urban area with a lot of people walking past the house and a lot of cars, and the Ring cannot tell the difference between them so I had to turn down the sensitivity to detect mostly people and it still doesn't know the difference. On top of that, it stops detecting motion when it gets dark out! I told Ring about that and they sent me some cheap plastic wedges to install under the doorbell that supposedly would solve the problem by redirecting the camera downward. Instead, the screws were so flimsy that they broke inside the wedges when I tried to put them up. Ring sent me replacement screws and the same thing happened so I threw away the wedges.<br><br>At one point Ring even sent a technician to my house to reinstall everything but he was unable to get it to work properly either. He basically gave up trying. In fact the technician disconnected my old doorbell and I had to reconnect it because I was hearing NOTHING when the Ring went offline!<br><br>I really wanted to like this product. When it works the way it's supposed to, it's great. I love the idea of being able to answer someone at my door even if I'm in another country. I love being able to see who is in front of my house without opening the door, especially if it's a delivery or someone allowing their dog to do its business on the sidewalk in front of my house! But I'd say it works correctly around 20% of the time at most, so what good is it? I now have to decide whether to try a different brand like Nest or just go back to my original mechanical doorbell.<br><br>All I know is that it's time for me to give up on this $250 piece of junk.

I’m averaging 5-10 seconds from the time I tap the GO LIVE button. And this is with 5 GHz WiFi, took even longer to activate when I first tried it with 2.4 GHz WiFi. Sometimes one gets lucky and the live feed takes about a second to activate but this is very rare. If you’re used to other cam vendors such as Wyze where the live feed almost always takes no more than a second to activate, you’ll find the Ring Pro disappointing. Alas, Wyze doesn’t offer a doorbell cam at this time.<br>- the motion-detection polygons aren’t as accurate as their visual representation would suggest. What do I mean by this? In short, you’ll often get motion alerts for people walking near BUT OUTSIDE your defined polygons.

  I bought this when it was on sale for $199. So if its at $250, just wait and it will drop $50. The pro version is a lot smaller than the regular version. The regular version is just ridiculously too big. It doesn't even look like a doorbell. But the pro version is better but not great. I understand why they really can't make it smaller right now. Components have to shrink and i sure thats happening as I write the review. Its still way bigger that average door bell. Another thing wrong with the product is annoying one. If you ever change your router or change your SSID or wifi name, you physically have to take the bottom portion of the ring pro off and press the button to find the wifi. Not very intuitive at all. Last bad thing is that they force to pay for a monthly fee of 3 or 4 bucks to keep the videos it stores to their servers. No possible way to store them locally, it has to go through Ring servers. Other than those few annoyances, the product is spot on.<br><br>It has a decent camera that does 1080p. It has night vision sensor that picks up pretty good. The audio quality is good too. Since its hardwired to your system, no need to deal with batteries. The response time on the sensor to the time the app is alerted is really fast. The app picks up the feed with hardly any delays. Most of the time, when the person is walking towards your door, you are alerted, by the time you open the app and check the live feed, that person has not waited more than a second or two. I have Netgears Arlo system also installed and delays are more than 10 to 15 seconds sometimes. It helps that the system is hardwired instead wireless. The app is decent too. You can set different ranges of sensitivity and different areas where the sensors could pick up movement. The app almost perfect, only because it can not reset the wifi info unless you a physical button on the hardware itself. It works great with the new Echo Show, all you have to say is Alexa show me the front door, and the image pops up on the echo show. Once you have something like this, its hard to go bad to an analog doorbell ringer

  Good save on this one. Acquainted myself with Ring by buying the original Ring doorbell. Awful product. I had low expectations but was surprised over and over about how awful the contrast was. How awful the video compression was. How awful the motion detection was. That product might have been cutting edge for 2011 but shouldn’t even be on the market today for even $60. It reminded me of something you’ll see on eBay for $25 by an unknown brand and poorly translated Engrish instructions. Now I don’t go on tangents on reviews but this was something else. The point where I gave up on the original ring was when I was getting a motion alert for every 5th car going down the street while it failed to detect the UPS man walk up my driveway to the porch. It continued detecting traffic and detected the package thief’s vehicle leave my driveway with my package. Yes, failed to detect the arrival of the vehicle. Failed to detect them walking up to porch. Two feet from camera. Failed to detect them walking back to vehicle. Only detected once they shut their door and drove off. Now I didn’t feel so bad about being robbed of my $10 carpet shampoo, but rather robbed of my $100 for that doorbell. It had to go. I did a YouTube binge and decided on Nest Hello being the better camera while the Ring Pro came in close second. But amazon has that oh so convenient option to buy this and pay for it over 5 monthly payments so I set my expectations to moderate and settled for the Ring Pro.<br><br>Pleasant surprise one: 4 faceplates to choose in the box unlike the base model.<br>Pleasant surprise two: an angle brack and a tilt bracket. Not included with base model<br>Pleasant surprise three: video compression is good. The original ring displayed a 720p video frame but the compression yeilded about 480p or less worth of detail. I expected roughly 720pish detail smeared across a 1080p video frame on Ring Pro but this is clearly 1080p. This would have captured the thief’s license plate if I had this one to begin with.<br>Improvement four: dynamic range. With all  south facing camera, the original ring would show a whiteish sky, whiteish street, driveway, and sidewalk. Dark objects showed as black or dark gray even if they were a dark blue or dark green. I had to guess the dark color of the thief’s vehicle. Ring pro shows the different shades of concrete, asphalt and gravel. Also shows a blue sky with white clouds.<br>Surprise five: motion detection is top notch. On the video frame, the city sidewalk and street are just a few pixels apart but motion detection completely ignores the street motion and alerts me to what I would guess is 90 percent of sidewalk traffic as I have set the motion zones to do so. This is not even remotely possible in the base Ring. Ring pro also gets the alert to my phone before any visitor has a chance to press the button or knock.

Ring excels in all three.<br>Setup was simple and intuitive and their videos provided easy to follow directions in all facets of the process. Plus, everything needed was included with the Ring (a dual usage screwdriver) with extras just in case (only two screws are required but three were provided). WiFi connection was also quick and simple and the app diagnostic (device health) gave a quick snapshot of power and WiFi status.<br>It works as described and there are several easily customizable features (motion settings and event history).<br>Customer Support was extraordinary; competent caring agents, quickly and easily accessible with great recommendations to enhance the client experience with the product and maximize its utility.<br>As with any product, there are opportunities to improve: The unit is slim so it fits on narrow spaces however the reset button is on the right side and if you install it in a place where it abuts an exterior wall or divide you have to completely remove the unit to do a reset (ie change to a different WiFi network, etc). Placing the reset on both sides or at the top or bottom would solve this problem.<br>Also, the LED night light can interfere with night sensors causing a very dim nighttime image. This is especially true if the unit abuts a wall (see above) causing a reflection. Having the ability to dim the nightlight or shut it down would help.<br>Make sure the firmware is up to date. My unit had a very old firmware and the installation did not do an adequate update however when I contacted Customer Support they quickly pushed the full update onto my unit.<br>The final criteria for a smart device is longevity and ongoing updates/improvements.  While I can’t speak to this I do have confidence that this too will be as successful as the other criteria.<br>So, if you’re in the market for a smart doorbell, Ring is the thing!

  Update:  Ring tech support worked with me and after another replacement unit was tried they sent me a Ring 2 to replace the Ring Pro.  This has a battery inside that can be pulled and charged or takes charge from the doorbell wiring.  This has the same video fidelity as the Ring Pro and I will be putting in a review of it under the Ring 2.  My suggestion is that unless your home is very modern or the doorbell wiring (not just the components like the voltage reducer and chime) is relatively new go with Ring 2.<br><br>The Amazon recommended  installer had to replace the transformer and chime unit, which isn't a big deal.  The big deal is the first unit totally died within 2 days.  The second unit works intermittently.  We can reset it by powering off for a minute or so and powering back on, but within 8-10 hours it fails again.  It is sitting on the other side of a wall with one of our Orbi Mesh satellites so I doubt wi-fi strength is the issue.<br><br>We have 2 Ring spotlights and they work great on our network and with our laptops so very disappointed with the doorbell.  According to the installer our experience is not that unusual.  The spotlights work fine but very often he is called back for problems with the doorbells.

  UPDATED REVIEW Nov. 1, 2018<br><br>I purchased the Ring Pro Doorbell in January 2018, installed it and it was running fine up to October 2018.  As you’ve probably read, there is a bit of work to do but it’s well worthwhile.  In mid-October the unit was not allowing the microphone to pick up any sound and after contacting Ring, a new one was sent and installed. Almost immediately  that unit had a crackling sound, rather loud and could be heard on the video. Contacted Ring again and a new one was sent.<br><br>While waiting for the second replacement to arrive, I was encouraged to check on the voltage of the transformer. I borrowed a voltmeter, did readings at the doorbell terminal, with the doorbell disconnected and at the transformer itself. The readings were all at 11.2.  In checking, the transformer is 10V. I ordered a 16V 30A transformer from Amazon and installed that in less then 5 minutes. (You do need to turn off the power and check to see if it’s off before attempting the change).  The voltmeter now reads 19.6 which is great since the Ring material states operating between 16 – 24V.  (Watched a number of YouTube videos for help).<br><br>The new Ring came today Nov. 1st, installed it with the now supplied angle bracket (drilled holes with the stucco drill bit) hooked to the new transformer and everything works like a charm. It is an easy set up, (just be patient) and enjoy all the features. The app is great and works well with the Ring Floodlight Cam.  I did have to buy the Chime Pro since the WiFi strength of the floodlight cam is pretty weak (must be a marketing technique since distance between the floodlight and the router is 20’) but it works well when the motion sensor gets triggered by animals and humans.<br><br>PROS: Ring.Com is very responsive and provided great customer service. Rather than blaming the customer, they sent out another unit (according to my electric friend, it is a circuit issue) not once but twice. I'm enjoying the three Ring products installed in the home. I'm looking into the Stick Up Cam but would love a loyalty sale (HINT).<br><br>CONS: I just wished they recommended checking the voltage on the transformer since not all are equal in voltage or at least mention to check the voltage somewhere in the documentation.<br><br>NEUTRAL:  Look at a lot of YouTube videos for install hints and the whole transformer drama might be solved earlier.<br><br>BOTTOM LINE:  I highly recommend that one can’t assume that the transformer for the mechanical doorbell is automatically 16V which is standard for the standard doorbell.  Ring simply states to hook this up to your current doorbell ASSUMING that you have the correct transformer voltage to handle the Ring and the standard doorbell chime. That may or may not be the cause of the problems with the other two units and it would have been good for Ring to state somewhere to have the transformer checked for the proper voltage. My electrician friend recommended that I check the voltage and I'm glad I did. This could have saved me hours in troubleshooting.  Never assume that the current transformer is the correct since mine was rated at 10V, the Ring Pro needs at least 16V and to find that out was a total shocker! (pun intended). Otherwise I love the Ring Pro, the connectivity is straight forward and is responsive to motion is very good. I’m very satisfied. Enjoy!

  Wow.  Where do I begin?<br><br>I have home security cameras set up inside my home.  They are Nest cams. I have always considered putting an additional Nest cam outdoors to monitor front door activity, but I didn't want to go through the extensive wiring and installation.  Really, in hindsight, perhaps I should have done that instead.<br><br>When Amazon announced their upcoming Echo Show (being released June 28th), I noticed that RING would be compatible with that product.  I thought it would be a great idea to have my Echo Show display whoever is at the door on its video screen, and allow me to talk to that individual without pulling my iPhone out of my pocket.<br><br>I really think it's a bit of a hassle to pull out an iPhone or grab the iPad every time someone rings the doorbell.  You have to grab the device and then launch the app.  That effort takes almost a minute to do while a person is waiting at your front door.  That is the reason why I never wanted to get the RING device, but now, it seems like it's compatibility with Echo Show might be a game changer.  Imagine just saying, ""Alexa show me the front door.""  At least, that is how I am hoping it will work.<br><br>So, along with ordering this Ring Video Doorbell I also ordered Amazon installation services at an extra $140.  I just didn't want to try to install this myself.  And, really, spending the extra money was a good thing as it led to additional problems that cost me an additional $200.  Please make very careful note of what I am about to tell you before considering buying this device for your home....<br><br>The Amazon service installer arrived on time.  Excellent individual.  He knew what he was doing and had the doorbell installed within 20 minutes.  Thing is, the Ring Video Doorbell wouldn't work.  Turns out, there's not enough power going to the doorbell from my transformer which is only putting out 14 volts.  The Amazon installer was not obligated to go any further than installing the doorbell, but he suggested I get an electrician to my home to install a more powerful transformer.<br><br>After several phone calls, I found an electrician who would come that day.  For just under $200 he installed a new 24-volt transformer that was in a crawl space in our basement.  That was the fix that the device needed and as soon as we turned the power back on, the Ring Doorbell came to life.<br><br>Pairing the doorbell to my home WiFi was effortless, but initially, the doorbell lost Internet connection for several hours.  The bad part is, in order to get it working again you have to take the safety screw out of the doorbell frame, which is a pain-in-the-neck.  Reason being, there is a side switch that the plate covers which is your only method of starting the reconnection/setup process.<br><br>The quality of the video that this doorbell puts out is decent.  It gives you a fish-eye view of your front or back yard.  My original doorbell was mounted a little low on the door frame and I was concerned it would not capture an individual close-up from head-to-toe.  Those fears were alleviated when I did some practice videos of myself.  The camera captured my entire face and body, even when it was mounted low on the door frame.<br><br>Now the really bad news:  Outgoing audio is abysmal.  Anyone at your front door can hardly hear the voice who is answering.  I mean, the audio is really, really low.  I can already sense there is going to be communication problems when someone comes to the front door.  I can't believe the folks at RING let this product go out with such poor speaker volume.<br><br>The software on the app side is better than it is on the website end, though I was a little disappointed that any viewing you do of past history is done in short clips.  Unlike Nest Cam, you can't simply sit and watch a chunk of video that the doorbell camera has taken.  On the website end -- and by that, I mean by going to RING.COM on my browser -- I was disappointed to see that there is no way to just watch live video and that everything presented is in clip format.<br><br>I think, when it comes right down to it, one is better just purchasing a camera that includes a microphone to monitor your doorway area rather than bother with RING.  That being said, Nest charges $100 a year for their cloud storage service while RING only charges $30.  I can tell you, as a NEST owner, their software and live monitoring is a night and day improvement over what RING offers.  Their speaker is also loud enough that you can actually hear the person addressing you.  A camera, with its larger lens, will also capture much more of your yard and allow more wider customer motion sensing capability.<br><br>I am not trying to trash RING.  It's probably the best ""bang for the buck"" for those on a budget.  It also seems to work pretty well for what it does.  However, the major drawbacks to this device is that there is a good chance you may have to call an electrician in and upgrade your transformer (see other Amazon reviews from customers who had to have this done), and, the speaker volume on the doorbell is really poor.<br><br>Finally, as I mentioned previously, realize what it takes to answer the door with RING when someone rings your doorbell.  You have to grab your tablet or phone, launch the app and then launch ""LIVE VIEW"" to see the person at the door.  That takes some time.  If you are planning to purchase the Amazon Echo Show, however, that may be the big reason to buy this device.  Hopefully, answering your door will be completely voice activated.<br><br>Be sure your home transformer is rated for 16 volts or more before even considering purchasing this device.  Otherwise, on top of the price of this product, you will be spending upwards of $200 for an electrician to come to your home.

  The product is great.  (let's be clear).<br><br>When/if your device fails, good luck my friend.  I bought my first (of three) ring door bell pros.  The first one was DOA (checked and verified everything on my end). I ended up returning it to amazon.  Second device came in, worked fantastic... for two days.  Than randomly started dropping the color green. Everything in the video looked like you were on drugs (see my picture).<br><br>So began my adventure into the Ring customer service... which REALLY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.<br><br>After waiting hours to get on the line (after multiple attempted calls, which they would just drop on me), i was able to speak to someone who didn't have a clue what was going (maybe he was new).  I went through the process of being put on and off of hold in 5 minute blocks for our entire conversation.<br><br>Finally, they decided to provide me a replacement. My gut told me to just go through amazon, but i decided to give them a chance (my mistake).<br><br>two whole weeks before the replacement got to me. two (f'n) weeks!  Seriously!  Problem two, replacing the unit. When i got the device, i signed up for the ring protect program.  Swapping the failed unit out with another one would be easy right?  Well physically, yes.  Billing wise, not at all.<br><br>Another 30 minute adventure on the phone, finally the lady just put me on hold and never returned.  (yup... that is what they do).  when the call rolled over to 45 minutes, i tapped out.  Who has this amount of time in their life for something as simple as  "" the device i purchased failed, i need a replacement... and i need you to move over what i paid for (the main thing you push on everyone), to the new device you sent me"".<br><br>my final response notification from them is that it will cost me an additional $30 to enroll the new device.  so basically i paid $30 that goes to a device i have to return to them.. and that subscription follows that device (or what i am guess to be).<br><br>Again, the product itself is pretty cool. Out of the competition, it is the best from what i can tell. but i wouldn't wish on my own worst enemy for anyone to have to pick up the phone and talk to them.

  What I like - Fairly easy install since existing doorbel met the power requirements, wife liked the options for faceplates and motion alerts are fairly responsive. Seeing neighborhood alerts feels helpful though too many people post rediculous pictures of foxes and varmints as if it's an issue.<br><br>What I dont - The option to select 'People Only' mode is only available if you subscribe to storage services, making this equipment fairly useless to me and I'm annoyed that wasn't clear in the features when I bought it.  I just set up a NAS storage and will likely end up replacing this unit with a brand that gives me more control of features and content.  I also likely won't be buying any other ring camera devices for those reasons.  Bought this on sale so I hopefully won't lose too much when I sell it locally.

  Good picture quality, but the app is seriously frustrating.  Video stored in 60 second increments.  If you have a lot of activity in the area and want to search for something it will take you hours to look through each 1 minute file.  Why can't they make a time slider like a traditional security cam? Also, Ring is the only system which makes you pay for every recording package.  Nest includes 3 days of saved footage.  With Ring, if someone steals a package,  you're screwed unless you happen to watch it live or pay for the service.

  Off the bat I will mention why this is not 5-stars.  I am pretty much in Apple's ecosystem and prefer reliability and centralization of HomeKit for home automation.  Unlike some, I have only had great use with my automation and HomeKit.  With that said, I am looking forward to Ring Pro finally rolling this out.  But as you may or may not know, the process is long with Apple's certification process so I am holding my breath :D... AT end I have two other dings to the star but this was the main one.<br><br>Now for the ring as a standalone product I am very happy with it.  I had wires already in my home providing a solid amount of voltage 18V to door.  Also had an indoor mechanical chime and unfortunately I could not get the Ring to work with it as my audible doorbell.  In the end Ring support sent me a free Chime (basic not Chime Pro) to allow me to have an audible ring inside the house.  Turned up all the way I can hear it anywhere and it's a great addition as we sometimes leave our phones in bedroom charging while watching TV in living room, so definitely needed a house chime of some sort.  We could never figure out why the in-house chime didn't work but kudos for them sending me free chime and not charging me.<br><br>As for software, so far the app is great.  Really responsive and fast.  One issue I read a lot about was the Ring connecting to wi-fi.  I am fortunate that the front door is about 10-12feet from my house router so I have no issues with signal strength.  Someone rings the bell I get immediate feedback, well about 2-4 second lag.  Which is not bad at all.<br><br>Where this system shines is with the motion alarms.  Set up one zone when I got it and it has been amazing.  I still get deliveries with people knocking on door instead of pressing the glowing button in front of them lol.... In the end it doesn't matter as motion and rings work the same, I am alerted and I can get clear video from front door.<br><br>I use this with a Friday Lock (they just released their product this past May) and it has been amazing.  My sister has come by on occasion and I have been able to let her in automatically.  Oddly she has been to house more often since I can let he run when at work.<br><br>Audio has been passable.  We are not getting the best audio hardware here, but all in all keep your expectations in check. You can clearly hear the person and so far they have heard me, except on windy days, that has caused us to repeat things several times.<br><br>Okay so the last two cons I have:<br>1. The subscription based recording.  So far I am still using the free and am thinking about need to continue with paying.  I like the idea of history of video but to be honest so far things have worked smoothly that as long as I am notified the instant of detection I really do not need video recording.  Everyone is doing subscription so it is to be expected.  Price is not bad just hate all these subscriptions in my life.<br>2. The angle of video is great horizontally but vertically it is lacking.  Of course no baby will ring my bell but the other day my dog got out of yard.  Luckily she stayed in from crying until my wife finally heard her.  Small dog and she was under the lowest sight of the camera so motion could not reach her.  Another couple of degrees and this would have not been an issue; I doubt it would be for many people.

  Day one installation is super easy. However once installed the door bell ran a firm ware update and now it drops off the network everytime it’s connected after about 10-20 minutes. I’m going to work with it for another day but unless there is another firmware update to will correct this the device is useless. My WiFi router isn’t about 20 feet away and I have AT&amp;T gigabit averaging 50+mbps up and down and normalcy more (downloads as fast as 175mbps). It’s a great concept but like so many others experience the device simply does not function as described. Hope there is an additional update it needs or it will be returned. I will update this review if the device improves with any sort of adjustment or update.<br><br>Update day 2:<br><br>I did go out and get a new Transformer from many reviews low power seems to be an issue. Home depot carries a multi voltage unit that is 14 dollars so i installed it first as 16 volts, and now as 24. The unit worked a little longer once connected to 24volts but then dropped off the network again. At the moment it says its running anther firmware update so I'm leaving it alone for a while it does show to be a bit behind on updates as the posted current Firmware version is 1.9.23 and mine shows 1.3.76. More updates if this gets any better right now I cant recommend this to anyone the device has not worked correctly for more than 30 minutes at 1 time.<br><br>Update Day 3:<br>Software finally updated to the current version and now shows 1.9.3. The sporadic dropping off the network continues. I contacted customer support, explained my issue, explained the steps I had taken including the new 24 volt transformer, and they walked me through multiple speed tests of the network in various locations. At the doorbell my download speed was 119 MBPS. Now there was variation in the speed at different locations, actually slowest standing next to the router getting only 46 mbps, so as a fix or possible fix the rep offered to send me a Ring wireless chime to use new the door bell as an extender to attempt to stabilize the speed and correct the constant drops I'm seeing. I will update this review again once the chime is received and installed. One concern is the rep I spoke with indicated I woudl receive a follow up email that as of yet has not come and I was to use that as a point of contact for any additional trouble....

After replacing my doorbell transformer, my doorbell chime and made modification to my wall to mount the ring doorbell camera it did not have enough internet bandwidth so I upgraded the internet but it is still not functioning as advertised.

After several emails with their Tech Support (who have actually tried to be very helpful), I have doubts as to whether this is something that is stable enough for me to keep.  I have experienced several issues, the latest of which is the device's inability to exit night vision mode (even when the sun is shining bright outside in the middle of the day).

The intent of something like this should be that you set it up and then forget about it while it's running.

  Installation of the hardware was fine, right up until we had to mount the doorbell to the supplied angle bracket. The instructions say use the two short machine screws to do so. The only problem is that those screws were only 1/4"" long, and would not even come out the back of the doorbell, much less screw into the angled base holes. We spent an unnecessary hour or so going through jars and plastic drawers, without finding any workable machine screws, before giving up and using some self-tapping sheet metal screws. Apparently they don't have any measuring tools in China!<br><br>So, once the hardware was installed and powered up, we downloaded the app, created an account and proceeded to follow the in app instructions, right up to locating our home wi-fi router. The app could find our neighbor's routers, each at least 75' away, but could not find either or our home networks (2.4 and 5.0) with a router only 25' away. Alexa, multiple lighting devices, multiple streaming devices and multiple iPhones and computers have no problem. But Ring appwas stymied. The suggested solution: bring the Ring device into the same room as our router! SAY WHAT? Turn the power back off, remove the faceplate, remove the mounting screws, hope the device recognizes the networks when within 6"" and then reinstall the device? What a PITA!<br><br>So, too much time invested to return, but we cannot recommend this device.<br><br>UPDATE: After additional research, I discovered Ring's recommendation to reset the router through the admin process, to make sure I was using 2.4 on channels 1-11. Should have made no diffference, because the Pro is supposed to work with both 2.4 and 5.0, but I did go in and check. Everything was fine on that end, no need to change any settings. Restarted router, and wonder of wonders, Ring found both networks it could not find the day before! Joined network and completed installation. So, I raised rating from 1 to 3 stars, because the Ring does what it is touted to do, once installed. However, the installation and set up tasks are way too difficult, especially when one has to scrounge for mounting screws. This is not ""plug and play!""

  If I could give it 0 stars I would. Ring Pro is not working for me. After 2 days of trying to re-install and watching several troubleshoot YouTube videos, I've been unable to resolve the issue. I've followed instructions to the t. The instructions in the kit are very vague. It does not consider that all homes are not a one size fits all. I've reached the point to where I'm hiring an electrical technician to take a look at my home wires and current doorbell. After reading several negative reviews, I know I am not the only frustrated customer experiencing the same issue. For $250, I expected convenience and quality. This product still has its flaws and appears to be in beta phase. I do not recommend purchasing this product unless you are willing to jump hoops, waste time, and pay additional money for parts and professional installation. Remember, this product is NOT a one size fits all. I am truly disappointed.

  Bought the doorbell and installed it and went pretty smooth. It dropped off line a couple of times and I had to manually install it again. The third time it stopped and that was it. Spent $60+ buying a 16v 30vac transformer, didn't help so i bought a 24 volt, didn't work. Contacted support several times. I have the other Ring items I bought that work great. Basically the device no longer goes into setup mode (spinning light). Waiting on a replacement unit. Once I install the new one I will update the review.<br>Update 7/2/2019<br>Got the replacement today from FedEx and installed it. Turned the power on and the doorbell went into setup mode immediately and I was able to get it connected, all is back to the way it was when I first installed it. Changed to 4 stars from 2 stars. Experience from Ring support was ok, but hard to say what went wrong. The doorbell itself was defective and failing within 3 days points to that. I now have the 2 wired stickup cams  and the doorbell working.<br>I waited a couple of years before buying the Ring products and I think that was a good decision. Not sure what past experiences were but the videos on the doorbell are not limited to 20 seconds. The sound is loud but not great as it can get choppy. I suspect that is due more to wifi connection than the product. Connection speeds are reasonably quick and I don't really have any complaints. I was able to read and understand that the video is stored in the cloud and not locally and I am ok with that. Price is reasonable and I don't expect free storage as many people I guess think they should get.

  This thing is just pathetic. Works great as long as you don't try to connect to it after a notification. Also, even if you don't try to connect to it, if someone pushes the doorbell button, the video freezes. Tried improving voltage, WiFi signal, firmware, etc., and still not working. I even reached out to customer service, and haven't even received a reply. I wanted this to work, I really did.

  I had discovered an issue recently where our doorbell would not ring. It had sufficient power, a good strong wifi signal and everything was properly set up. I called ring support and when they pulled a diagnostic report of the doorbell they said it was too hot to operate. The internal temp of the doorbell was over 150 degrees. Our front door faces east and the doorbell gets direct morning sun. It was 8:30 am and 90 degrees outside. The temperature of the stucco wall next to the doorbell was 111 degrees, but since the doorbell is black the internal temperature of the doorbell was over 150 degrees. They said the doorbell will not operate over 120 degrees Fahrenheit.  If I pay more money to ring I can get one of their chimes that will still work, even though my doorbell SHOULD work fine no matter what in normal weather conditions which this is. Everything else on the doorbell works fine, it just won't make the connection to ring our internal mechanical chime so it's hard to fathom why heat would impact just that and not everything else. There is no reason that this should not work. It's just a matter of connecting a circuit. This is not extreme circumstances either. This is just a normal Arizona sunny morning in an area of the house that gets direct sunlight exposure until about noon. There is NO reason that these doorbells should not be able to handle hotter temperatures or at least be better protected from direct sunlight. I'm sure these doorbells work fine in shaded areas but when your door is in direct sun forget about it. Don't waste your money if your front door has any direct sun exposure at all. Find something different that is not as poorly made as Ring products are.

  I don’t know if these were defective and that is why they were marked down but quality is way below acceptable. I have spent over an hour on the phone with Ring support and it is still not working correctly. My friends have disconnected theirs for several reasons - 1 - signal was terrible and box is right inside the door. It would work if the cover was off but as soon as they put the cover back on the signal would not work.  2 - eats up your data plan.<br>I called Ring support twice. First time, he “guaranteed” me that if I got a signal booster, the bell would work. Rather than fet the Ring chime, I opted for purchasing three pods from Xfinity. One is directly inside the front door and the bell is still not working correctly.  Hundreds of dollars later and the Ring is still not functioning fully. And now, the doorbell is not working and, when it was, you had to push the bell really, really hard. So frustrating.

  In the end it’s a great unit, but during set up there are quite a few things they don’t tell you like you have to have a certain transformer with a certain output in order for it to work properly, which most homes do not have and must be replaced before going any further for the unit to work. After you jump that hurdle one of the problems I ran into was if you have a battery back up on your digital doorbell, it tries to jump in And take over for the unit.  After removing the back up batteries unit finished setting up properly and works as described. Also I could only set the unit up on my android, the iPad iPhone app would not allow it to go through. Must be a glitch there.  Their customer service is spotty, my first contact went well and informed me about the transformer issues. But the second contact it sounded like she was trying to do dishes while you were trying to talk to her and she was not attentive to the questions being asked, with a lot of dead silence on the phone, kind of sounded like you were interrupting her day ....<br><br> But in the end it after three days of struggles and ordering parts and etc. once it started working, it worked absolutely as described and I still consider it to be an asset to have....

  Ring is a great idea. I gave it three stars only because the product is expensive and for this price, they try to annoy you by asking you to subscribe to the cloud recording each time you miss a ring or a motion. Please compare to the absolutely marvelous blink which is much cheaper and much more complete. I hate it when companies use cloud to gouge the unwitting customer. Another complaint: The motion detector is too sensitive. Mostly false alarms. I will be buying more Blinks to get around the cloud recording annoyance.

  I was able to install two of these, one for me and one for my neighbor, in about 10 minutes for each. The video quality is excellent. The app allows for some pretty sophisticated customization so that notifications don't drive you insane. I think that's what really separates Ring from the other cameras out there. You're able to adjust where the camera responds to motion triggers and how sensitive it is to motion within that area. Also, the camera only uses bandwidth when it senses motion, whereas other cameras record constantly and can eat up to 300GB of data in a month.<br><br>Since installing it I've seen several times where people come up to my house after dark, see the Ring, then do an immediate about-face back down the driveway! I also like how easy the app makes it to share video and snapshots with other Ring owners in the community. We got ours because a house inside our neighborhood, but about 1/4 mile from my address, was broken into while everyone was away at work. Seeing how effective it is at deterring people who know what that white glowing circle in the dark means is exactly the piece of mind I was hoping for.

  Installed this camera about 5 days ago.  I've been tweaking the settings constantly since then, trying to get it to be useful, and I've pretty much given up.  If you have a clear view from wherever you want to place this camera - no shrubs, trees, etc - then it's probably great.  Picture is good, sound quality is decent, excellent night vision.  However, if you have anything in view that moves - like the aforementioned shrubs and trees - forget it.  You will get notices (amusingly enough, a wind chime alert) constantly, all day long, if it's breezy out.  Yes, there's a setting for ""People Only"" and no, it doesn't work.  I've reduced the motion zone to frankly a much smaller area that I want monitored, and it still tells me the leaves are moving.  So all in all, this is useless for what I need - notification that someone has come up my driveway, into my yard,  or to my door.  I'll keep it because I already installed it and  does record everything, but I also purchased 2 of the Ring Flood Light Cameras for use in the backyard, and those are definitely going back.<br><br>Also of note - it won't connect to my doorbell chime, despite checking for compatibility and ensuring the settings are correct in the app.  And the app is pretty horrible - not intuitive at all.<br><br>Would definitely not recommend this product.

  I waited quite a while to buy the Ring doorbell camera because I have a lot of cameras at my house and one on the porch. However, the big issue was I could not talk to someone at my door. A lot of burglars first go to the door if they do not know if someone is home. If someone answers they will make up some stupid story and go on their way. If someone does not answer, then they may break-in. This happened to a neighbor because she did not answer the door and next thing she knew one of the guys that had been at the door was shattering her rear slider. The Ring doorbell camera allows me to answer and tell the person I am busy or whatever I want to say at that moment.<br><br>Video has the fish eye effect and therefor is odd looking, which really seems to bother some people. However, this is necessary to get a wide view. A view that is too narrow is almost useless, especially when this camera needs to fit the needs of every type of porch. The fish eye look used to bother me, but I was used to it before I got the Ring.<br><br>The quality of the video is great and I love that it is stored in the cloud. I ordered the protection plus plan because I also have the Ring security system, so I can add as many cameras as I like. As mentioned, I already have a lot of standard surveillance cameras, but I may add a couple Ring cameras for the two-way audio. I would love to be able to tell my dog to stop doing something when I am away and I can see she is up to no good... I've wanted to do that so many times!<br><br>I really like how Ring is constantly innovating, and one example is their neighborhood app that allows people to share videos. I like getting an alert when there is something suspicious going on in my area or even showing some lost dogs. Some articles have called it ""selling fear"" or criticized allowing law enforcement the ability to view publicly posted videos or even request copies from videos from the owners (anyone can install and use the app and it is not limited to Ring customers). These complaints are ridiculous. If something is publicly posted then someone should not expect privacy. If someone does not want to share video with law enforcement then that is their choice with no legal consequences. These articles take the criticisms too far and have frankly been ridiculous.<br><br>The Cons<br><br>I have few complaints, but there are always some because there is always room for improvement. One such complaint is a problem with every camera I've had on my porch - shadows from a tree. We get a lot of wind and the shadows in the afternoon trip motion detection on every camera I have ever used. At least the Ring has less false alarms because of the angle of the view. The other complaint was not the fault of Ring - it was my router. I picked the Ring Pro for a few reasons, but one was 5 GHz WiFi. This WiFi frequency is much faster than 2.4 GHz, but the range is not as far. The Ring connected, but I found it troublesome so I changed to the better signal on 2.4 GHz. I don't have an issue with bandwidth on this frequency, but I will buy an access point if I ever want 5 GHz that bad or add more cameras on WiFi.

  This thing doesn't do its main job: to alert you when somebody is at the door and let you get in contact with that somebody while you are away. When I am noticed about motion detected, and I am away and on phone data network (Verizon), it may take about 10 minutes to get a view: I click on the notification on phone, then wait and wait. After 4-5 minutes I get a live view, but obviously the person is long gone by that time. I can't even see what was because I get the live view and history that ended about 15 minutes before current time (so, the motion part is not included). If I close it and open again, I will get the motion recording but this takes another 5 minutes.<br>To summarize, there is no way to use this device to answer to door ring when you are away (unless you put a note on the door: Ring the bell and wait for 15 minutes!)<br>If you are at home, on local wifi router, it would be faster, but still faster to go to the door and see with your own eyes.<br>To summarize, this device does achieve its purpose, but it can be used as a camera to watch the outdoor, or see whoever was at your door during the day.

  I don’t normally write bad reviews but I’ve bought this for my Dad as a Christmas gift. The first Ring Doorbell Pro didn’t work straight out of the box. The setup video didn’t even correspond to our model but to the original Ring. You could think they’d have a separate video for their “Pro” version. We couldn’t get past the setup stage due to product not transmitting WiFi signal. My dad and I spent several hours looking online for a fix and noticed several hundred posts with the exact same issue. We contacted Ring Customer service and went through their troubleshooting. They eventually said “send it back for a replacement.” Sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement. We then received the 2nd Ring Doorbell Pro went to setup it up and had the exact same issue again! Looked up more post for troubleshooting and found there might actually be a current issue. Some posts stated that the current had to be at 16 to 24 (you want 24 since people were having issues at night when the infrared lights turned on) with an amp of 1. Ring or Ring Customer service never explained this to their own customers nor on the box. So we bought a new transformer at our local Home Depot which doubled the amount of current we needed costing an extra $55 more. Called Ring Customer service and they went through there normal on script troubleshooting process. Still wouldn’t transmit any WiFi signal to iOS or android phone. Told Ring customer service rep about installing a new transformer and they said yes please install the new transformer. We had a professional electrician install the new transformer which costed an extra of $70. Put the Ring Doorbell back on and same issue. Called and emailed Ring Customer service and they said “send it back for a new one.” Went on Amazon and replacement wasn’t an option. Back to calling Ring Customer service again and they wouldn’t want to match their Ring Doorbell Pro but give me the original Ring Doorbell which is $100 cheaper (720p version) and wanted my credit card information as well. That was the BEST they could do. All I wanted was an actual working product and Ring couldn’t supply that on their high end model. I will never buy a Ring product again and you shouldn’t too. There is thousands and thousands of none working Ring Doorbells on EBay which is a prime example that they have no quality control.

  It took quite awhile to get power to the device from the transformer. After sending one unit back per tech support saying it was bad, the replacement doorbell was having the same issue. We replaced everything that touched the doorbell except for the wires in the wall. Nothing worked. Finally we took the doorbell to the transformer and hooked it directly to the transformer and it lit right up. We left it there to charge for about an hour then moved it back to the front door. It works like a champ now. I would highly recommend this product IF you upgrade your transformer. It needs the extra power. This is my second ring doorbell, the first one just quit (I'm guessing it was because of the old transformer). The first one was a pro as well but it didn't work half as fast as this one is working now. You can't beat the security it adds to your home. I greeted some kids at 1am when I was 200 miles away that were trying to break into my house. Needless to say, it didn't happen.

Yep, went that route only to redo everything I had already done- still no solution... I finally had to tell Fatima that it was time to end this nonsense and ship me a new working product (like the one I already paid for).  So in total I spent around $1,500 dollars in product alone as I also purchased floodlight cameras and the ring pro doorbell (plus the licensed electrician installing all of this).  The solution??  Fatima would authorize shipping out a replacement in 5 business days, I explained to her that that was unacceptable and items can be sent overnight all over the globe and that since this is a PERSONAL SECURITY product before anything else that Ring should expedite my product.  She said that she couldn’t do that, therefore I asked to speak with her manager so that they fully understood the amount of money we’re talking about here.  She then places me on hold, eventually comes back and lies to me that “her manager has now authorized an expedited order” - TOTAL LIE just to get me off of the phone (mind you that she’s getting paid for that phone call, for me, that’s my personal time).  So here it is Wednesday of the following week and the product hasn’t even shipped according to the tracking information that they provided in the follow up email.

Here's the shocker, it didn't work.<br>First day it was about 2 hours of resetting the system and trying different things, no connection.<br>Second day  even though I listed in advance all the steps I went through on my own and with the previous support technician, it was even longer because the tech support wanted me to set up Hot Spot from my phone to verify sufficient WiFi connection, even though I get over 60 mbps at the location on the Ring Doorbell.<br>Another item to note, the doorbell device stopped going into reset mode altogether the evening before at some point which I told them the first thing but they kept asking me to try to reset the device and go through WiFi connection procedure.<br>So the tech support person finally sends me a questionnaire asking about the time my doorbell stopped communicating with the Ring Chime which had nothing to do with the issue but they insisted I had to fill out all the questions.<br>By the time I got to the third or fourth, chat system hung up on me due to inactivity even though I was busy typing.<br>Needless to say I was pissed by now because altogether I had spent around 6+ hours on this thing over past two and half days.<br>Contacted support and asked them to have a supervisor call me but the guy wanted to chat with me and I lost it by then.<br>All in all, this product had issues but bigger issue is the support built around it, the techs are basically reading a handbook and relaying the info which I found more detailed information on You Tube. In addition the time I wasted on this broken device and it should have been pretty obvious with all the information I provided on second day, which they didn't bother to read through. They could have saved hours and gone to the heart of the matter and have a satisfied customer Vs. wasting mine and their own time and having a pissed off customer which will be returning a Ring Pro, Ring Chime and an Echo Show device.<br>I'll make sure to contact them as well and give them my feedback.

  An updated review: I previously had written that the doorbell was not capable of being installed directly to the transformer without a resistor, which was not included. Although my frustration with ring still stands, I feel like I owe this a fair update, and maybe help someone else out. I was originally pointed (not by Ring) to a Ring help/instruction page requiring a resistor be installed in order to hook directly to the transformer. As it turns out, that is only for the two other models and not the pro. The pro does come with a 'pro power kit' which has the ability to bypass the doorbell chime. This takes some digging to find out, but it's there. So, if you're like me and do not have a chime- peel the sticker off of the part and you will find two small holes to put in line with the doorbell. That said, I'm still not overly impressed with Ring as a whole, doorbell or security wise. Everything is big and clunky from the doorbell to their crazy huge door contact sensors. But I am happy to know that I did receive all the parts necessary to install it. Hopefully they updated their help article to include this info!

  Save your money and buy something else like an Arlo or one of the stand alone doorbell cams for $50!  I'm not a wirehead and sometimes I'm technically challenged, but I can build a computer, rebuild an engine and fix things, but this Ring Video Doorbell almost put me over the edge...It doesn't go into setup mode as described in the instructions, won't connect to wifi even with 5 bars, drops the wifi connection continuously, and seems to have a mind of it's own!  I changed the transformer as required, put in the power kit as required and placed it with 25 feet of my Router...could be the fact that I have an AT&amp;T router which is another story in itself...DON'T BUY!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET SOMETHING ELSE!!

So I had a professional installer lined up to install it (brand new house and two left hands here) he installed I setup all worked fine.<br>I bought this because we had TONS of packages stolen.<br>Sometime around 9pm the unit crashed. Boom. Wifi wouldn't work. Next day. I didn't realize yet the unit was dead I got a delivery....guess what....it got stolen. Great isn't it. I was past my Amazon return window June 7th.....Friday. not 24 hrs after installation. Damn right? I called Ring at the lady on the phone (Hi Jacky, thanks a lot) had me do the troubleshooting for about an hour before she agreed to overnight me a new unit (remember the overnight)<br>Today, Monday the 10th I waited for FedEx, who came and went. I emailed said Jacky, to request a tracking number to see where the delay was. About an hour later I got a form email. Tracking number issued. Package not send yet. Da faq?<br>So I called Ring. Turns out They don't do overnight. Jacky told me a story, yay me. They do expedited....which also didn't happen. So, now I am pissed, can't send it back, and am stuck with a security company who's employee was less than straight with me. Thanks Jacky.

  UPDATED 5/13/2020<br>After I placed the below review Ring contacted me to help me get better performance for my Ring Doorbell. I was shocked. They sent me a new unit and worked with me to update the unit with new firmware. The unit works well apart from a few false alerts from people walking by the house on the sidewalk. I have continued to adjust the alert zone without compromising sensitivity. I am hoping I got the adjustment right as it's pretty touchy. The processing video for an alert takes a bit and I do miss some interactions but I can switch to the ""live view"". So overall I would feel comfortable recommending this product if one was looking for a doorbell camera. The best thing about this interaction was no one pestered me about changing my review. I had asked them if they were going to make me update my review and they said ""no, not unless you want to"". So I waited, I think it's been at least 8 months to a year and not a peep. I am impressed so I decided on my own fruition to make this update. So in closing, is it perfect, maybe not quite but pretty close and with tech like this, pretty close is good enough for me. Thanks Ring! You are a class act!<br><br>Not ready for prime time. For the price you are getting a half baked product. If you think you will be able to answer your door from anywhere you are mistaken. If you’re not on your own WIFI the lag is so terrible by the time you connect (if you’re even able to) the person is gone. How many missed packages that had to be redelivered because of this lag? Terrible! Not what I imagined it would be. Overpriced and underperforming. Idea is good, execution is garbage. Promises way more than it delivers.

  First know that you will likely need to change your door bell transformer, it pulls a lot of power. Also you need a VERY strong WiFi signal. don't expect to push a button and see the alert that happened 3 minutes ago, you need to wait while it 'processes' the video. this means that if something was stolen you wont see proof of it if you check the video too quickly.<br>example<br>ring alert 'motion detected'<br>pick up phone and open app then look at live view to see nothing, switch to view the time the actual motion was detected and see 'processing' after 2-3 min you can view the video...<br>someone stole your package? they are now long gone because you had to wait to see the video.<br><br> The picture is very good on this and It detects stuff well. My biggest problem and the reason it lost 2 stars is because if you change your routers WiFi names you can not easily  change it on the device you have to climb up to the device (in my cast on top of a building) and remove the over and press a button. this is really crappy, I could be able to change the WiFi information within the app.

  I purchased the device and installed it easily according to the direction and video. It was pretty easy to install and connect to the app. It worked great for about 2 hrs. then it disconnected from the wifi. I followed all of the troubleshooting guides, with no luck.  I tried the typical re-set ups, disconnecting and connecting again, etc. I reached out to customer service and was even more disappointed.  They just tried to push me to purchase more Ring branded adapters to fix the problem and at one point ended the chat with me before we were done. I had to restart the chat.  I even sent pictures of the wiring, connection, and was told that it was connected correctly. Customer service referred me to an electrician to fix my issue with the device and pushed me to purchase additional Ring items. Very disappointing.  For the amount of money these things cost, that is terrible service in my mind. I hope no one else experiences that.

  This is good technology when it works, which is RARELY. Very often, when I click on ""Live View"" to see what's going on, the device says it can't connect to the internet. I have one cable modem and THREE other devices to distribute wifi in my house, and I never have a problem with connectivity with any other device. I have NEVER been able to answer the doorbell remotely -- every time Ring tells me someone has run my doorbell (which isn't always, as connectivity is always spotty), and I click to answer, I get the spinny wheel and it NEVER connects. Several times, it has simply stopped working without me realizing it -- I will walk near the front door, and then notice that my phone has not given me an alert, then I check and, sure enough, it's not connected -- without ever letting me know. I also had issues with motion detection -- even the breeze moving the flowers along my front walk would set it off, despite me messing with sensitivity. Overall: POOR product, TERRIBLE reliability.

  Our doorbell wasn’t working well - the wiring was 1950 vintage and all the insulation was failing. My wife saw some footage a neighbor posted online of a porch package thief and it made me think it would be good to kill two birds with one stone.<br><br>I wanted to insure that whatever we did would have hard power instead of solar or batteries. A lot of online reviews of Ring talk about added latency, but in our experience so far it’s perfectly acceptable - a couple seconds at most.<br><br>Because of our decrepit wiring, I fashioned a dedicated power supply from an 18 VAC transformer and a 20W 20Ω series resistor. With that setup, ring functions perfectly. Our house is small and the WiFi AP is just behind one stucco wall, so connectivity is not a problem.<br><br>I think we missed a lot of reported problems with Ring by not being the first folks to install one. I think a lot of kinks have been worked out by now.<br><br>One thing I like is that motion-detection capture videos start from a few seconds before the motion event. I’m sure that having the Ring be hard-powered (as opposed to batteries) is what makes this possible.<br><br>Our doorbell is/was hard up against our door on a perpendicular wall. Given that, almost half the video frame is just the door itself. We have a “wedge” kit on order to angle the Ring outwards just a bit. If your placement is similar, you might want to consider buying one in the same order. They also have tilt wedges so you can aim the camera more downwards to see the ground. In our installation, you can’t see the ground, so we may not be able to see that there are packages waiting. However, with the motion capture system you can see the delivery person actually bringing it and dropping it off, so there’s probably not much need.<br><br>If I had a gripe it’s that they currently don’t integrate with HomeKit. If they did, then I could use it’s motion detection to turn on our porch light. That would be the only missing feature I can think of.

  I installed this on my front door, approx 30' from the WiFi router. Connected it to a 20-year-old dorrbell transformer which worked perfectly. Used the included wedge to tilt the camera down -- the siding that it is mounted on tilts up, so this evens it out. Now I get motion alerts when someone starts walking up the stairs to my front door, several seconds before they get to the doorbell. Used the motion zones to not alert on motion in the street in front of my house and that works about 90% of the time (the other 10% I get an alert, mostly at night, from trucks going by near the house).<br><br>Had a few troubles getting started and having the app see the doorbell. After I did a factory reset everything worked first time. And I love getting an alert on my Echo Show and being able to see the person at the door and talk to them without going to the door.<br><br>Very happy with the wired camera so I don't need to deal with batteries.

  Updated this review after using it for a long time. Generally like the product, but it has its drawbacks. Make sure you have a minimum 16v running to your doorbell, it won't function otherwise. I also received a defective doorbell twice, but customer service was great and took care of it immediately. My major critique on the doorbell is the significant lag, both for capturing motion events and when someone rings the doorbell. The motion alerts are activated, but the doorbell misses the first few seconds of recording - which is quite useless if you are trying to see what is going on. There is also a decent lag between ringing the doorbell and getting the notification to interact with it. We've tested it numerous times, and it is not immediate. most of the times people are leaving our front door by the time the video kicks in and you can respond.<br><br>A note about the video quality. On the first two units we received, the image was grainy, anything but HD. We've come to discover that Ring defaults your video resolution to a lower setting unless you call their customer service to actually get better quality. Also, they've recently changed their video resolution playback - which is now run through a smoothing filter to make it appear like it is HD. It actually just blurs the image a bit to trick you. It's a very deceptive product with little real upside on its performance.<br><br>Setup and everything else was easy. Wish they would correct the lag - especially given the price.

The process is great and the support available to help set up is also great. from the box to the wall and fully functional was literally 20 minutes. Couldn't have been easier. Video looked great and connection to the existing mechanical doorbell is easy as well. My router sits next to the door and I always had less than -50 RSSI (lower is better). The video out of the box was great and the auto-night camera functions flawlessly. My issue resided with the audio. It was always garbled and electronic. Useless when trying to communicate two way (the whole reason you buy a video doorbell).<br><br>My internet plan is 300 mbps download with 30 mbps upload. Verified by ISP and verified through numerous speed test sites. I tried to connect via 2.4 and 5.0 gHz bands and both had same audio issue. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Nothing. I performed a factory reset on the device. Nothing. I completely redid the install and all steps associated with setting the device up as brand new... Nothing.<br><br>I contacted customer service and tried to see if I could resolve the issue with their help. The agent had me do all the steps I'd already tried, but I complied in the instance that perhaps he knew something or knew a step I missed. Nope. He ran through a couple of things all the while claiming that it was my ISP and that the device was getting less than 1 mbps upload speed. This was only from their side. Every other test I ran and that the ISP ran showed at least 30 mbps upload. This went on via email for a couple of weeks.<br><br>Out of pure frustration, I contacted one of the customer service agents that monitors these boards and plead for help. She was AWESOME and responded quickly. She connected me to someone on a special escalation team and he was even more supportive. He set time with me and we connected. He listened to what steps I took with the other agent and agreed that we needed to see if it was the device. He sent another device and a chime pro to see if the extender might help. I'd like to note he sent the Chime Pro at no cost to me. He connected me to someone local that came out to my house. If that's not customer service, I don't know what is! The replacement device was even worse than the original and had a horrible screeching feedback. With the local person here we tested both devices with no solution that would resolve issue. He spent 3+ hours at my house. Again, way above and beyond my expectations for customer service.<br><br>So I was left with a device that I couldn't use and hoping for a firmware update that would resolve the issue. My neighbor purchased a Nest Hello and he knew I was having difficulty with the Ring so he graciously volunteered his device for me to test to see if it would be any better. We installed and VOILA! A video doorbell that had clear audio and video on the same connection as the Ring. This confirmed my suspicion that the ISP was not the issue.<br><br>I really wanted to love this device. It was great and totally baked into my Echo infrastructure. Too bad Amazon acquired Ring and not Nest. I've given up on the ring after around a month or so of issue and moved to the Nest Hello. No issues, crystal clear audio and video. And I can talk to someone with crystal clear audio on both sides. Please feel free to comment with questions and I will do my best to answer if I can.

  Really want to like this product, and I think they could get it right, but just way too many issues that the tech support staff cant even address properly.  Low power is apparently a rampant problem for the pro, and there is no documentation or other support to help identify that you need a near custom transformer to properly supply these units with the massive volt/amps needed to avoid issues (not just voltage, but current draw as well). Also, there is definitely and issue with whatever RF transceiver these guys are using - I have other products including 1080p HD cameras siting on the same network / router with comparable distances / obstacles and they have NO issues. The ring however always has high interference and low bandwidth metrics associated with it. Tech support responses to both of these issues is A) sorry, yeah we know we forgot to mention the volt/amps problem in the documentation but we are working on it, and B) you need to buy our wifi extender to solve the interference problem, even though you don't need it for other products (not kidding - they said it was because the ring cameras are ""special""). Sorry guys, lack of documentation and using up-sell tactics to compensate for poor hardware just doesn't cut it these days in my mind.

  These Ring products are HIGHLY over-rated!  The audio and video signals are not clear.  The audio cuts in and out to the point where conversing with the person at your door is simply not possible.  The video gets pixelated and is difficult to view.  The camera itself is sub-standard.  Anything within 10 feet is clear but beyond that it's just a blur.  You would think with today's camera lens technology Ring could provide a more distant clear field of view. But it does not.  Anyone or anything that causes the alarm to kick in - and is more than 10 feet away from the Doorbell may as well be wearing a disguise because you will surely not be able to discern who or what it is that set off the alarm.  Then there's the latency between the time the Doorbell triggers an alarm and the time when you actually get to view the video.  So long that any perpetrator would have stolen your packages and be in the next town!  And then there's the unexplainable drops in connection.  Complete loss of video and audio.  Ring techs can't even figure out how to solve this problem.  And NO, it's not because my wifi speed is too slow or my wifi router is too far away.  I run at 300mbps and I'm only 25 feet from my Doorbell camera.  The product just simply does NOT perform as advertised.  I feel like I have wasted hundreds of my hard earned dollars on a security system that is more trouble than anything else.  It's actually a joke or better yet - a Ring SCAM!  Do not purchase any Ring product.  They simply do not work.  Followup: Oct. 28th, 2019:  Nothing has changed.  Today I got an alert that someone was at my front door.  So I quickly launched my Ring app. and waited, and waited and waited and waited for it to connect so I could see and talk to whoever was there.  After about 10 minutes, I finally got connected and guess what - my visitor was gone and so would have been any value packages that might have been sitting on my doorstep.

Ring products just do not work.<br><br>Update: Several months after installing the Ring Doorbell.<br>The function of my Ring product, doorbell and solar camera, continue to degrade to the point where they are simply useless.

  While the product's intent is good and works most of the time, mine died today after having it 2 years and 3 months. So beware that if you purchase one, you may  have to either spend another $249  in a couple of years to replace it. I had also spent $50 to buy an indoor chime which now does nothing unless I shell out another $249. I contacted Amazon help @amazonhelp, and was told since it only had a one year warranty, too bad.<br><br>I have had good wifi signal (shows 39mb and 30mb up and download), and voltage was good with my tester. However, there were times  when it would lose the connection and I would have to go reset it. When someone came to the door, I could not see who was there without waiting for the app to load, and and get a live view., which usually took about a minute. Which to me was not very responsive. So now, I guess I'll either go back to my analog doorbell, or get one where a mounted display shows immediately. I cannot recommend a product that simply has this short of lifespan for that amount of money.<br><br>Edit update 1/4/2019: After tweeting to Ring.com, they reached out to me and sent me a replacement, which I installed and it has good power, good wifi and seems to be working just fine. Thank you Ring for making me feel better about my investment!<br><br>The only issue keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the delay in seeing who is at the door. The app takes too long to load on my iPhone 8 plus, and by the time it loads to show me who is at the door, either they left, or I feel the sense of urgency to answer the door myself.<br><br>I recommend that the app have a user controlled setting to allow it to automatically load, rather than just give me a notification on my phone. Otherwise it seems to  work great at the moment.

  If you're thinking this is just a fancier doorbell, this is more like going from VHS to a DVR.  Yes, it rings your phone when someone pushes the doorbell button and you can see &amp; talk to the person from anywhere in the house.  You can also see and talk to them even if you're away from home, so you can give a delivery guy some instructions.<br><br>You can also go through the logs and see everyone that came by your house when you were gone.  Setup motion zones and you can see anytime someone stopped by.  Are you wondering if your package arrived yet?  Check the ring events and see if there's been anyone outside today.<br><br>Is there some noise or commotion out front of your house?  Just switch to the live view and have a look.<br><br>This was easy to install in 15 minutes, but for some reason it disabled the indoor doorbell chime when I installed it.  The only notification someone pushed the doorbell was from the app.  I replaced the doorbell transformer twice (because that's what comes up when you google ""why doesn't doorbell work with ring"") until I found the setting and turned it back on.

  Edit: after my original review I received several emails from a Ring rep who wanted to figure out why I was having the problems I was having, and to help me solve the problem. As it turned out, after several emails, phones calls, and trials, we kept coming up with the same problems. One of the last possible solutions Ring had for me put me about a week over my return limit with Amazon before it was known that the problems remained. I have several perfectly functioning Ring devices, so I told them I wanted to exchange the bad Pro unit for other Ring products. They promptly sent out the new products, and sent me a return label for the bad Pro unit. I still stand by my original review of a single star for the Pro unit. Maybe future upgrades will make a better product. However I added two stars for the absolutely amazing customer service the Ring company provided. They stand behind their products, and they go out of the way to make sure you are happy one way or another. I would and plan on buying Ring products in the future. The only reason I don't put 5 stars here is because it will misslead folks about THIS product.<br><br>I have had a ring basic for about three years and loved it. So I decided to upgrade to the ring pro. I followed the instructions perfectly, and at first the pro worked great. I got all the settings how I wanted, and for about two days the pro seemed like a great upgrade. But then it started going offline for 12 plus hours of the day. I called ring and their help line said to make sure I have the right transformer. They emailed me an Amazon link and I purchased it. After installation of the new transformer, everything was great again...for about two days. Then it was back to going offline for 12 plus hours a day. I called ring back, and got the same info as before with nothing new about how to get this darn thing working. I returned the pro, thinking it was just the device that was bad, and got another one. Same problem, like clockwork, two days later. So I tried a different approach. I got a plugin transformer and skipped the doorbell wiring completely. Again a few days later it went offline. I loved the added features and quality of the camera before it stopped working, but for this price, it's just not work the hassle. I'll be returning the pro and going back to the ring basic. Don't waste your time on the pro, it's utter crap.

  I tried to install it. My transformer provides 17Vac but 10Vac drops on the chime, leaving only 7Vac for the Ring Pro. I called Ring.com and was told to upgrade the transformer to 24Vac 30VA because the doorbell pro needs at least 16V. When I asked what was a normal voltage drop on the chime (standby) I could not get any answer.I mentioned that my chime allows no more than 16Vac, and was told it was not a problem because the power kit protects it. I was promised some proof in writing, but instead they sent me just a link to general installation instructions. There is nothing online supporting such a claim. I tried to find a 24Vac Chime but there is nothing at a reasonable price on Amazon. I went through Ring Chime compatibility list and could not find even a single chime reasonably priced on Amazon. Most of them just do not exist on Amazon. Why put out a list of chimes that cannot be purchased?? Bottom line - I am returning the unit because I cannot get any tech support that will help me with this installation.

  This is a fantastic video doorbell. I was concerned enough about needing to change my transformer (16 VAC) and ordered a 24 VAC one along with the Ring Pro. I opted to install the doorbell first, just to see how things worked out. Installation was a breeze. In fact, it took longer for me to locate the doorbell and chime breakers (and test them) than it did to install!  It did take me a couple of tries to connect to my wi-fi network, which was surprising since the wi-fi router is only about 50 feet from my front door. The doorbell works just fine with my current transformer and I've opted not to replace it. Device health is always in the green (routinely 4000-4100 mV) for voltage, as well as network signal strength. I really appreciate the Motion Snooze feature as we like to spend time on our front porch while the weather is nice. Adjusting the motion zones is so simple and it nice to not get alerts when cars drive by or neighbors across the street are out. I appreciate that it can detect my small dog, but ignore the birds that have nested in my hanging basket. The audio works well. Maybe too well as my partner has taken to sending me video messages! The night vision on the camera is surprisingly excellent. The only negative for me is that I find the outdoor chime a bit annoying, and the delay between the outdoor chime and indoor chime is off-putting. But, I shouldn't have to ring my own front doorbell very often! Overall, I'm very pleased with the device and highly recommend it.

  I've had the Ring Pro up for about a year and it has worked fine -- until now.  Based on the reports in the online Ring Community forum, the software was recently updated and now, lots of doorbells are going off multiple times a day -- even multiple times per hour.  Let me be clear:  I successfully installed this doorbell and used it with minimal problems for a year.  Then, without my doing anything to the doorbell settings, I am receiving numerous ""false alarms"" and, for a while, numerous ""phantom rings"" on my mechanical doorbell.  I couldn't find anything on the Ring support site that addressed this, but upon turning to the community forums, I found out that I was not alone. Ring recently pushed new software that has a significant bug that it needs to fix immediately.  I contacted them via Chat (left a message after waiting 5 min and getting no response) but have heard nothing.  The word in the forum is that a fix is being sent out, but I haven't received any information about it.  The other word in the forum is that Ring responds to comments on Amazon.  I am hopeful.

  I work with cameras on a daily basis, and I never thought I would actually own one of these.  Even though I have my home completely covered by cameras, why would I need a ring doorbell?  The mere fact that this product has been well designed and has a ton of features it does what my cameras can’t.<br><br>First of all, the pro version is a wired version, which means No batteries.  It’s not hard at all to install, Just make sure you check the voltage of the doorbell power inverter and make sure it’s between 18-24 volts.  Based on some of the reviews, people in older homes had issue with it not working.  Replace the transformer is the correct voltage is not there and this will work fine.  Most of your doorbell transformers on up on your garage wall, or if your in a much older home, they are in the bell box itself.  Remember to shut the power off to the door bell when installing this for safety.  The other option is if you have echo devices throughout your home, then don’t buy the ring chime extender, you won’t need it.  Just download the ring skill into your amazon echo app, and use your echo devices to alert you through the home when the doorbell is pressed.  I was fortunate to catch the amazon bundle of the ring doorbell pro and the echo 5 show for $179 with one day shipping!!!!

  I would give this a quality review if it wasn't for the horrible customer service I encountered. The first item was defective and wouldn't power on. I spent an hour with customer service: shutting off breakers, pushing buttons, holding down buttons, taking pictured of the transformer, checking wiring, and measuring voltage.<br><br>The voltage tested on the low side with 16v so after seeing a picture of my transformer they deemed it necessary to install a new transformer. So, I called the electrician and set up an appointment. When he came out, several days later, he said he had installed a lot of the doorbells and my voltage tested low but should have been adequate. Since he was there and I already had to pay him for the visit I went ahead with the installation. The doorbell still didn't power up.<br><br>So now I've paid to have a new transformer installed and checked by an electrician but it's not enough for support. Guess what I get to do? Run through all the tests again: shutting off breakers, pushing buttons, holding down buttons, taking pictured of the transformer, checking wiring, and measuring voltage. After an hour it still wasn't good enough for the support team. They needed photos of the transformer to prove it was good enough. Even though the electrician said he installed this model of transformer all the time for Ring doorbells and took proper measurements it wasn't enough for support. So, I hung up on them, shipped it back to Amazon, and tried to order a new one.<br><br>And when I tried to get a replacement? Out of stock! Over two weeks from my initial order, totally missing my initial intent to have it when I went on vacation, I finally got a new doorbell and it worked perfectly. What a waste of my time and money. I hope I never have to deal with their customer support again or I'm not ordering a Ring anything, ever again.

  I waited until the Pro came out before jumping on the smart doorbell bandwagon.  When I did, I liked it so much that I purchased one for my in-laws' home as well.  The fit and format work well for my home, I did use a 20 degree baseplate to tilt the camera for a better viewing angle.  My biggest nitpick is that I live on a busy residential street, and the strength of the audio coming from the doorbell's speaker is weak.  Several people that we've tried to talk to could not hear what we were saying, unless they put their ear within inches of the doorbell.  Also, my in-laws aren't too happy to have to subscribe to a monthly cloud plan.  I would have paid $100 more for the unit if it would have came bundled with a lifetime of cloud storage.<br><br>Nitpicks aside, the video and audio that is recorded are superb.  The user-defined areas for motion alerts are impressively accurate,  I'm able to prevent false alerts from happening when cars drive by, which I'm unable to do with my full-blown Q-See home security camera system.  So, kudos to the software guys at Ring, they are doing great work.

  Initially, I had purchased a Ring Doorbell (original model) and gave it a workout at home over the course of a week. I ended up returning it due to a congested 2.4ghz neighborhood and no option for 5ghz. These need to have a ‘Good’ signal otherwise the picture and video quality are going to be awful.<br><br>Let’s talk about the install experience. A few things:<br><br>1.  This doorbell requires a  transformer 16-24vac. This really important part is that the transformer has to be rated for at least 15va. I found that my existing doorbell transformer was 10va. After reading a ton of online reviews where some doorbells would not boot or has poor performance, I also purchased a 24vac, 20va. However, 16vac, 30va is good as well.  Save yourself trouble and buy a new transformer.  Make sure you are using standard bell wire and not something stupid like CAT5 or speaker wire. Don’t risk burning your house down if the wrong wire was used.<br><br>2.  For those of you upgrading from the first Rng doorbell, a retrofit mounting kit is included that covers all the old holes you drilled and allows mounting the new doorbell.  This was a nice addition by ring.<br><br>3.  The first unit I received from Amazon was dead on arrival.  This was really infuriating.  I spent an hour troubleshooting by myself, and then another half hour with Ring before it was considered a dead unit. I did a very quick swap with Amazon who makes returns and exchanges really easy. Thanks to a nearby Amazon drop location, I had a new one the next morning.<br><br>3.  This unit has screw terminals on the rear of the doorbell itself.  If you decide to use the wire clips, you may need to make the wire holes a little bigger to push the clips in.  Otherwise, if your existing leads are long enough you can directly attach to the unit. For any of you that are replacing a basic push button doorbell, I recommend a pair of wire strippers in case your leads are not long enough to work with.<br><br>4. The programming procedure was really simple.  I was surprised to hear the doorbell talk to me and step me through the process along with the Ring doorbell app. This was pretty cool.<br><br>So, here are the use observations:<br><br>1.  I love the fact that this device supports 5Ghz. It’s a huge improvement over the first gen unit and I’ve had zero signal issues with the unit itself. Video feed, picture, and speed of connection are great!<br><br>2.  The extra color faceplates that are included are a really nice.  It’s great to not be stuck forever with a specific color choice. We went with white as it matches the door trim.<br><br>3.  I noticed that with the Pro version of the doorbell, there is a slight delay with the mechanical doorbell chime that we have. We also have a Ring Chime unit which rings before the mechanical doorbell.  I would say the delay is about 2 seconds from button press which is perfectly acceptable.<br><br>4.  Motion zones are awesome on this. I love the fact I was able to draw the zones I wanted to focus on for motion. The old Ring would run into tons of erroneous motion events. The new Ring Pro is almost error free provided you draw the zones rights.<br><br>In summary, I highly recommend this version of the product over the older editions.  Spend the extra money and get the experience you want to have the first time around.

  I was pretty excited to install my Ring doorbell after having researched them a few months back. I've had it for about a month now, and there's some stuff I love, and some I really hate. Most recently I was pretty alarmed to find out that it lacks a critical security feature: notification when the camera stops checking in via the internet.<br><br>The install was pretty easy, I just had to drill some anchors into my stucco on top of where my old, smaller traditional doorbell button was attached, add a little wire thing in the old doorbell, and then get it on my wifi. For a regular do-it-your-selfer, this was no big deal and didn't require any special tools.<br><br>After getting the motion zones set up and the angle right on the doorbell, it has been doing exactly what we wanted it to: letting us know when people are at the front door, whether they hit the button or not, without having too many false positives. A few times it has captured some animals in the middle of the night, or car lights reflecting off things in the driveway, but most of the time it buzzes when there's a person or car in the motion zones, which is great.<br><br>Most of the time it's fine, though during busy periods this can get annoying. The Android app makes snoozing kind of a pain, requiring you to pick not only ""snooze"" but then in0side the app, choose how long to snooze for. Just snooze for 15 minutes and I'll adjust longer if I need to. In fact I have a TicWatch Pro which is fully integrated with my Google Pixel XL2, but I can't snooze the Ring from it, because hitting ""snooze"" on the watch just opens the screen on the phone, which is completely pointless.<br><br>Further, I have some Google Home Assistant speakers in the house which I had hoped would have some integrations, but no dice really. Any claims of integration between them as of today are misleading. Ring seems to want to stay in Amazon's walled garden, and as such, there's basically no real way to use your ring from Google Home Assistant. This is a huge disappointment, as I know Alexa users get full 2-way voice between their Ring and Alexa speakers. These walled gardens are just annoying, especially when you have made a choice on best product, not best ecosystem, to purchase. I'd really love to be able to say ""Hey Google. Snooze my Ring Doorbell for 2 hours"" as well, but that doesn't work.<br><br>And finally, the real reason this review drops from 4 stars all the way to 2. I just got back from a camping trip, which was full of bliss and harmony away from the bustle of the city. But I realized upon arriving home that my doorbell didn't alert me to *my* presence. When I finally got unpacked and took a look, it seemed my entire home wifi had gone down for an unrelated reason, causing the Ring to lose its ability to do anything other than buzz the traditional chime. The whole point of having a connected doorbell is to see who comes to your door while you're not away.<br><br>This is such a simple thing for them to implement. Just tell me when the doorbell is offline. Not doing it makes it pretty vulnerable to a very simple attack: cut neighborhood cable loop and nobody will know their rings are offline until it is too late to do anything about it.<br><br>Fix that in a software update and I'll be glad to amend this review and pop it back up to 4 stars. But until them, buyer beware: this product is deeply flawed for security purposes. You'll want something more robust if you really want to know who is coming to your door all the time.

  I read the reviews on the older versions about the connectivity issues before purchasing the Pro version hoping it would be better. Those same issues still exist with this version as well. There is a 50% chance anytime you want to view a live shot of what the camera is seeing that the WiFi connection will be loss. I thought maybe it was because my WiFi  box was too far away from the front door (it's on another floor). I purchased a WiFi extender which sits less than 20 ft from the doorbell. I checked the WiFi signals being received at the from door and both are extremely strong. Non the less the doorbell losses the connection. None of my other devices in the house have this issue. There is also a long delay getting the video to show when someone rings the bell. If I had it to do over again I would not buy the Ring Video Doorbell Pro.

The product information doesn’t tell you that you need a higher  capacity transformer than what a standard door bell uses. However if you call the company they will send you one (I was told it would arrive in 3 days, but it took over 2 weeks). You have to pay an extra monthly fee for most of the features.

So if you add to the system with other devices, you're just digging yourself in deeper. Ring has no intention of fixing it's problems with the ""Activating Device"" issue. It put the R&amp;D money into inventing more substandard garbage for people to purchase. So the only outcome is a 100% loss of your investment.<br><br>Sorry Ring, I used you for years, but you're just another well marketed POS, who only cares about screwing people out of their $3 per month times a zillion victims times a zillion months. So that answers that question of flat one-time vs subscription fees.

  I got the Ring doorbell, a remote WiFi interior bell and a power transformer to supply power to doorbell.  ALL are Ring hardware.  Title says it all.  Doorbell won't stay connected to any of 3 WiFi options even tho I have 4 smart TV's and 3 phones that have NO PROBLEM staying connected.  Doorbell is within about 20 feet of WiFi.  Interior bell won't stay connected to doorbell and lastly, power supply gives reading that power receptacle is inadequate.  I have an advanced engineering degree and tons of home remodel under my belt.  Ring ---- shame on you.  DO NOT BUY this product.<br><br>REPLY TO RING COMMENT:  The Ring power transformer is plugged into a 120-volt / 20 amp circuit with nearly nothing else connected to that circuit.  Let me clarify:  it's a 20 AMP circuit and 120 volts.  I live in a city with excellent power supply.  I tested the power source with two different multimeters.  IN ADDITION, when the doorbell loses WiFi connection, trying to reconnect it ALWAYS gives instructions to TAKE OFF the doorbell cover which has a small star screw at its base and press a button only accessible if you take off the cover.  ARE YOU KIDDING?  The power supply and my tools are in the garage; so, I go to the garage and unplug the power supply or I get the specialized screw driver and .... yadda, yadda, yadda.  These products are JUNK.  This is NOT ""new"" technology.  Again, SHAME on you Ring.

  I don’t usually write a lot of reviews, but I felt compelled to write one in the case of the ring doorbell, not so much in terms of what it can do, but in terms of the potential which it has (but is currently missing).<br><br>The Good<br>- Packaging was excellent with the different face plates and mounting brackets which have all been well thought through.<br>- The device seems well made (caveat that most of my testing has been indoors as I am waiting to install this at a house which is still under renovation, fingers crossed it will survive outside).<br>- Wifi integration and setup with Amazon Echo Show 5 was relatively easy<br>- “Potential” to get rid of wires<br><br>The Ok<br>- Video quality from the device is at best ok<br>- Audio quality on the device end could be better but it does what it needs to. Maybe a forward facing speaker would help, but audio will always be a challenge on smaller devices.<br><br>What could be better (where most of my comments are has been broken them down into different functions/features which need to be improved).<br><br>(1) AUTO LAUNCH THE VIDEO ON SELECTED DEVICES<br><br>When someone presses the ring doorbell, you get an “announcement” on the echo show telling you that someone is at the front door. You then have to ask “aelxa” to show you the front door. This is the first and most obvious failing, namely there is a lag from when you ask “alexa” to when the video of the front door starts showing.<br><br>I have excellent broadband and good wifi but the answering sequence means it takes around 10s from when the doorbell is rung to when I can speak to the person on the other side. This could easily be resolved if you allow the echo show (and there should be an option for more than one of them to do this at the same time) to automatically show the front door when the doorbell is pressed, saving on the connection delays.<br><br>Where you have smart devices in a household this SHOULD be a no brainer. Hopefully this will be addressed soon especially since Amazon now has acquired ring.<br><br>(2) ALLOW ANSWERING THE DOOR WITH A BUTTON<br><br>I live in a multi-generational household and introducing technology like ring is always going to be a challenge especially since I have young kids and elderly grandparents under the same roof.<br><br>When the announcement comes through the echo show that there is someone at the front door, the only option to answer is a voice activation to speak commands to alexa.<br><br>Contrast to how the echo show works when you call between rooms (I am also using the echo show as an intercom) you get an option of pressing an onscreen button to answer the call, this feature should really be included.<br><br>Again, with Ring now in Amazon’s stable, hopefully this will be addressed soon.<br><br>(3) WIFI ONLY MODE<br><br>Finally, and this is probably the most challenging, would be to allow the ring to work in a wifi only mode without internet connectivity. This would allow faster response times from the devices within the same household and also provide backup where the internet is sketchy.<br><br>I love cutting cables and ring was so close to allowing me to set up a new house without the need to wire my front doorbell, but the device’s over reliance on internet connectivity is a problem.<br><br>I know this runs counter to some of the ring's best selling points (namely that you can record everything on the cloud and answer your doorbell when you are out), but it is equally annoying to think you could actually be physically in the house and not know someone is at your front door (if the internet is down). There are many smart home products which have the ability to function when the internet is down on wifi alone. If this means buying another “gateway” device, it would be a welcome if it addressed this concern.<br><br>In Conclusion<br><br>The house where this is being used has 3 floors, and when you add all of the issues together the whole ecosystem is just not quite ready. The delays, the possibility that it might not be offline, coupled together with trying to simplify the experience for people of different ages means that the whole ecosystem (ring + echo show) demonstrates so much potential, but still falls short. Whatever the case is, I am still betting it is going to get better and will live with the complaints I am sure to face from the family till it hopefully does.

  Well I guess it works ok, one thing you will need to do is turn on human detection and turn off any motion detection, unit comes set up to record all that moves, soon you realize picking up every car that passes by is not worth it, so set up to detect human motion. Also they don't make it clear that after 30 days all you can door is see live video and not the recorded video that happened earlier. That's another 30 dollars to be able to view recorded events . I was not to happy about that. They did not make that clear when I bought it. Also it came with a small white plastic box I had to wire in to my current doorbell chime inside the house. I guess overall it's nice, but didn't like the fees to store my recorded video and the fact I had to have a electrician wire in this small gadjet to my existing door bell chime in hallway

  My previous  Ring Pro stopped working in about 18 months after installation.  I gave a try again as I hope that new one is better than old one.  I cannot review for new Ring pro yet since it has been installed for only two months.  My bigger complaint was Ring didn't make subscription transfer easy.  Instead, Ring just charged new subscription so I was double charged with the remaining 6 moths subscription I have already paid previously.  Surprisingly, Ring didn't have provision for replacement of devices and its service continuity.  Ring's chat customer service was horribly wrong.  Each response takes at least 5 to 10 minutes.  I spent one hour to make 10 lines of conversation and had to enter 'hello' continuously to avoid chat line inactivity which stops the chat automatically.  I eventually found a phone number to contact to fix it, but I felt really disappointed with ineffective system Ring has even though it is a Amazon company now.

I can see all the way down the street plus more. The quality of images is so much better than I could of imagined. I decided on going w/ the wired one. So that was the only pain because my original doorbell hadn’t be wired installed. So I hired someone myself to get that done witch was more work than I thought.

  I bought one these during prime days since they we $100 off.  It worked great for about three days after the install but then went off line.  After about a hour on the phone with a very nice tech support person I realized the transformer on my existing doorbell did not meet the amperage requirements.  Mine was 16 volts 10 amps (which is common) and Ring recommends 16 volts 30 amps to keep the internal battery charged. This requirement is clearly stated in the tech data but not easily found. I ordered a 30 amp transformer and I am awaiting delivery......<br><br>Update..... Even after the install of the 30 AMP transformer the Ring didn’t work.  A replacement was sent promptly and seems to be working fine.  My guess is that the Pro Power pack that is installed on the doorbell ringer was faulty because the old Ring fired right up once the new power pack was installed.

  I wish I could give this no stars. I believe that the descriptions on this page about the system requirements for this to function are not correct. After four months of trying to install this, multiple calls to Ring support and ordering multiple additional items at their request, it still won't work at all (more details below). They would not even consider that the unit might be defective. Had to settle for only an 80% refund from Amazon because I was outside of the return window. Would recommend that if you take a chance on this and it doesn't work right away, just return it. Ring will not be able to help you solve any problems.<br><br>This would not work out of the box.  My dad and I (college educated, highly competent humans) spent 3 hours trying to install with no luck. Called Ring support and had to get into the wall and take apart the intercom system. Ring decided that we needed a more powerful transformer. The power they suggested we need is not a commonly available item and NO WHERE does it say such a thing might be needed (they only mention needing an ordinary doorbell transformer). We ordered it and it was back ordered, so it took 2 months to get here.  We took apart the wall again and installed the new transformer; still no response from the Ring device whatsoever. Called Ring support again. They made us try all kinds of things, many of them now multiple times and take pictures (presumably to ensure that we weren't idiots) and take even more stuff apart.  Still no response of any kind from the Ring device.  Ring support now decided that maybe the Ring wouldn't work with our digital doorbell so they sent out a replacement part for the doorbell adapter we installed with the original setup.  They also sent a list of compatible doorbells so we can go out and buy one that works with their product.  (Why they could not supply such a list from the beginning is....)  They were supposed to also send a bypass to take the digital doorbell out of service (so you don't know when someone is at the door?)  They didn't send the bypass but we bypassed it anyway.  Still no response.  This is besides the fact that I had to take the old button and speaker out and make a wooden insert to replace it and to mount the Ring button. Such a frustrating experience that cost us quite a bit of money (20% unrefundable purchase price plus all the additional items we purchased) all for the privilege.

  I bought this so I could know who was at my door throughout the day, and it came (mostly) recommended by a couple of neighbors, so I thought it would work for my purposes. Looking back, I literally wouldn't even pay $10 for this thing, much less $276 (after tax) + $30 for a wifi extender + $30 for the Ring Chime. Set up was pretty easy, but it was all down hill from there.<br><br>Here's why I'm sending this thing back...<br><br>1. Camera/Video Quality - The camera quality is 1080p, but it's SO SLOW, it fails to even catch an object in continual motion. It's just a pixel-y and blurry freeze-frame, so what's the point in paying so much extra for 1080p? Someone said my internet might be too slow/far away, so I bought a wifi extender (add $30) which made absolutely NO difference.<br><br>2. ""Live View"" Rarely, If Ever Works - And when when it rarely does, it takes FOREVER to pull up. Most of the time it doesn't even pull up at all though. ""Your phone is having trouble connecting to Ring."" Annoying.<br><br>3. If you want to receive alerts in the middle of the night that are actually loud enough to wake you up if someone is at your front door, you have to buy their ""Ring Chime"" (+$30).<br><br>4. Hit or Miss on Detecting Motion - I've walked right by this thing...in broad daylight...with the settings set to the most sensitive...without it even picking me up....SEVERAL times.<br><br>5. Hit After Hit on the WRONG Motions - I start getting flooded with notifications around 2:30pm until about 4:45 every day when the sun starts shining directly towards the camera, making it send a (false) motion notification (or more like 30) to my phone.  I tried to adjust the sensitivity and boundary settings to see if I could alter it somehow, but due to the positioning of my front door, the doorbell, and the sun, I couldn't.<br><br>6. Blank Video Recording - Oh wait! It detected motion on my front porch early one weekend morning...oh, wait...no...it just got audio...the video screen is totally black. : /<br><br>7. Motion Detection is Delayed - Yes, UPS delivery guys are fast, but Ring takes SO LONG to even notice they're there, that they're already back in their truck and driving off by the time it starts recording.<br><br>8. Bad Field of View - It's smaller on this one than on the last ring, but I thought the 1080p (vs. 720p on the original) would be worth it. It's not. I installed it at the highest spot I could put it (without having a big hole next to by door from the previous doorbell), and it chopped off my 6' 2"" husband's head from the nose up (the one time the motion video caught him on camera...when he'd been standing at the door with 2 briefcases, fumbling with his keys for a minute).<br><br>9. Night View is a Joke - It's too light right next to the camera and pitch black 3 feet away, and is too slow to adjust in time to catch anything on camera...so what's the point. I tried adjusting the porch lights and different lights inside, but it didn't help at all.<br><br>10. Cost of Use - $276 (after tax) for the doorbell + $30 for the wifi extender + $30 for the Ring Chime + $30/year for storage (which, why would you pay for storage if it's hit or miss on actually recording?) = $366 initial investment.  That's way too much for a janky doorbell, IMO.<br><br>I could literally go on, but I don't want this piece of junk to invade any more of my life. If I haven't convinced you not to get it by now, go ahead and try it! Maybe it will work for you (I hope it does, because it's a cool CONCEPT)...but you'll probably end up returning it too. : /

  An excerpt of the conclusion from our published story: The Ring Video Doorbell Pro is an amazing smart home solution for both security and communication with visitors when you are not home. The camera quality is wonderful and so is their cloud service. Thanks to the perfect price they have chosen for it, it is absolutely worth the monthly cost, especially as they work to further improve it in the future. Thanks to our own experience with the doorbell, we can’t do much more than brag about how user-friendly and useful it is to have. We have even had a few others in the office buy one in the last 24 hours because of it all (from the original story). This leads us to offering a tip of the hat to Ring.<br><br>It isn't absolutely perfect, as they do experience some audio issues for a lot of users when it comes to two-way communication. Sometimes from the app, your guest's voice may come through the doorbell to you distorted. If you find that your having this issue, and you aren't too far from your router or anything else that could be degrading signal, it's wise to reach out to Ring and talk to them. They will most likely swap out the unit for you. We have one here that has this exact issue that we have kept to the side for the soul purpose of seeing if Ring ever does figure out what is causing (it truly feels like a firmware issue).<br><br>Despite the last part, the Ring doorbells are still some of our favorites when it comes to features and performance, as well as subscription prices (that's a big one). We have seen monthly prices that range from $5-$10+ per camera, for access to cloud services. Ring however is smart and keep their price to only $3 per camera or $9.99 for unlimited. Although we have seen companies that offer ""free"" cloud services as well, however we have yet to find one that lives up to the quality of Ring's. Plus, their neighborhood feature works far too well for keeping your neighbors in the loop when suspicious and immediate activity is taking place.<br><br>**If you have found our review helpful, please vote it as helpful below so I know.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific Video Doorbell...,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2020","<span>
  I originally started with the Ring Doorbell 2 because my existing wiring had gone bad recently and I wasn’t about to restring through multiple walls. However, I wasn’t happy with the wake up time for motion detection, so I decide to go with the Ring Pro and buy the plug in adapter and run it under my shingles and into my garage.<br><br>This thing has been great. The customizable motion detection zones make this thing so much better than the battery operated ones and their limited expanding/detracting sphere only. I am able to draw a zone that covers my yard, right up to the road and my driveway without getting false alerts due to cars driving by. On the Ring 2, if I shrunk the sphere to avoid false s from cars driving by, it would no longer cover my driveway, which I needed covered.<br><br>The other thing that makes the Pro better is the recording of several seconds of video BEFORE the event actually was triggered. The Pro records on a small internal loop so when a motion alert is triggered, it adds several seconds of video BEFORE the event occurred, to the save recording(this is what the Ring 3 tries to address for battery doorbells).<br><br>The alerts are prompt and with the Rapid Ring app, I am able to get I to live view very quickly.<br><br>About the only complaint I have it the night vision. It’s pretty good but I have a front porch light on all night and thus there really isn’t a need for night vision. However, unlike the flood light, where when the light turns on, the night vision turns off, on the doorbell, the night vision stays on, even with light and there is no way to turn it off in the settings. I’d like to see them offer an option.<br><br>PROS<br>Excellent motion detection<br>Customizable motion detection zones<br>Adds several seconds to the the recordings PRIOR to the event happening, so you see it all.<br>Night vision very good<br>Slimmer design(width wise) than the Ring 2.<br><br>CONS<br>No ability to turn OFF night vision when you have a well lit area, like having the front porch light on. It should operate similar to the flood light.<br>I’m not a huge fan of the newer version’s domed button. I prefer the older concave. The domed version, when it is hot out, somtimes indents(it does come back into shape though) when pressed.<br><br>All in all this is a great video doorbell and IMO worth the upgrade and effort to wire it, over the battery versions.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Please Read.. This is the Worst time to Buy anything RING!,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2020","<span>
  Please take a moment and read this. I was huge Ring fan. I have 3 flood light cams, a door bell, and I ordered a spot light camera that I returned. BUT RING has changed for the worst. I installed Ring alarms and cameras in my parents and grand parents home. I now regret getting them wrapped up in the Ring ecosystem.<br><br>Over the last year, they've pushed out updates that were not necessary that broke basic features such as two way audio. Additionally, with the release of updated mobile phone software such as Android 10, other feature were no longer compatible and Ring has opted to not even bother to find solutions.  Their customer service used to be phenomenal. Representatives knew what they were talking about. Now thier customer support has been bid out to the lowest call center where the representative barely comprehends what you're asking, much less has no idea how to provide ""technical"" support. Do you know why there's so many more Ring marketing commercials on TV? Easy...marketing is cheaper the actual R&amp;D.<br><br>Here's is some of the ongoing issues that will vary from user to user...again, I want to stress these don't apply to everyone, but more and more folks are having these issues regularly.<br><br>1) Ring rolled out a new feature called ""Event History Timeline"" which let's you view your motion events in a timeline vs the old list view call up method. This ""feature"" when turned on reduces/distorts the two way audio at the Ring Door bell. Specifically the Ring Door Bell Pro more so than others. Ring reps have acknowledged the issue and their response is almost always the same, check with your device (phone) manufacturer. The idea eludes them that the issue was caused by them. And for a while this issue was fine because you used to be able to turn off this feature and leave it off. But  RING has decided that they want this on no matter the headache it causes on the customer. So it now comes ON by default. And despite turing it off, every update forces it back on. An issue you don't realize is active unitl the next person presses your doorbell and they can't hear you.<br><br>2) Ring video call-up connects a two way call as an actual call on you mobile device. Depending on how your device manufacturer handles calls and it's connections Bluetooth, it causes major conflicts with the Ring devices.<br><br>For example: If your phone is connected to a smart watch via Bluetooth, and you get a Ring notification, when you connect to the video stream, the device (watch) may or may not be compatible with the call type. This a major issue with a major smart watch company. You can hear the caller, but you can't speak back to them since the device doesn't properly transmit return audio. Ring's stance, contact the manufacturer, it's the watches fault). They could easily implement a toggle to let you flip between Bluetooth, or the phone's speaker, but they have no desire to fix the issue. Instead, you have to keep your smartwatch disconnected from your phone. Miserable experience.<br><br>Another example of the Bluetooth issue is if you have your phone connected to another Bluetooth device such as your car and you get a ring notification, your phone immediately silences all other media in lieu of the Bluetooth connected Ring video call. The problem is that majority of the time the two way audio between the phone/Bluetooth device/and Ring device does not work. The moment you turn off the Bluetooth on your phone, the audio returns and the person on the end of the Ring call can hear you again. This is a major glitch that is unnecessary. If Ring has these many issues properly connecting a call through Bluetooth... Just stop forcing my calls/video call-ups through Bluetooth. Or for the love of God, just put a toggle to switch Audio sources like Amazon did for Alexa video calls. Not hard.<br><br>And then there times you end the call, and Ring is no long showing on your phone. But you can't figure out what you can't make another call. Or why the media on your phone won't keep playing where it left off. Well it's because Ring is still active in the background and the phone still thinks it's in a call.

The person at your porch is gone. Looong gone.<br><br>And this is IF the stream actually connects. 50% of the time you get a messages that says ""authenticating the device"" ""connecting to the stream"" ""beginning stream"" blah blah blah... Only to never get a connection. Ring will ask you to send them the health of the device and the RSSI which indicates the strength of your connection and all these things will be just fine on your hardware. They'll never figure out why the device doesn't work. As I mentioned; useless technical support.<br><br>4) They have features on in their app that have never worked and they have no plans to fix them. Like snoozing notifications from a device. You're cutting your grass and the back yard camera keeps going off. You swipe down on the notification and it asks you if you would like to snooze the notification for 30 mins, 1 hour, 2 hours. You pick 2 hours and the notification goes away. 2 mins later, Ding... there's someone in your back yard. Yup.. Your still getting notifications. This hasn't worked in years... You think Ring is going to fix it... Nope. Because folks keep buying thier devices.<br><br>If your buying these devices for security reasons, they won't help. You'll miss the porch burglar.<br><br>If your buying these devices to speak to visitors who come to your home, you won't be able to talk to them.<br><br>If your buying these devices because of reliability, don't. The quality of the their software and app makes the hardware worthless.<br><br>There's so many other brands out there that do all of these things so much better. And if you're looking at Ring because it integrates into your Echo, so do many many other brands now.<br><br>Brands that will call you with an educated technical support agent that speaks English and will actually try to figure out your issues.

2.0 out of 5 stars,The speaker in this doorbell is garbage.,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2019","<span>
  I cannot in good conscience give this a 5-star review. While the camera works amazing and it's got very good video quality for doorbells the speaker on this particular doorbell completely sucks! You can't hear anything through the speaker outside. You have to scream into your phone so that someone can actually hear your voice at any audible level from the device. This is a known issue with this doorbell as it's a slimmer size than the other ring doorbells meaning they had to use a smaller speaker and I'm guessing somewhere down the line of testing there were like a let's just use a small speaker and not even test the features to make sure it's actually going to work I absolutely love ring don't get me wrong I have a complete ring alarm system and I'm very happy with ring and all of the cameras this doorbell is the only thing that I have any issue with out of their entire system.

  UPDATE:<br>I wrote a very damning review when I first got this Ring Doorbell Pro. It had so many problems that I gave up and emailed support. Whoever answered me said ""you can send it back for a full refund"". I wanted help but didn't get it. I sent it back. Ring then contacted me and said they wanted to get this right with me so we worked together to get it working. It was a matter of a very poor wifi signal getting to my front door. They offered me several options but nothing got better. They said I needed to upgrade my wireless signal. I have CenturyLink DSL and an old modem. I upgraded to a new CenturyLink modem and a faster speed (40MBS). That didn't do much good. CenturyLink's internal router isn't nearly strong enough for a 2,000 sqft house. I got a Netgear Nighthawk and that did the trick throughout the house. Now that I have a decent signal, my Ring Doorbell Pro works fantastic. I have no complaints. It does exactly what I wanted it to do.<br><br>FIRST REVIEW:<br>I so wanted this to work. Everything it said it did matched exactly with my needs. I was very willing to spend the $3.00 per month for the cloud storage. When I got the package I was impressed by the packaging, device itself and the tools they supply. I had read a lot of the bad reviews because I always do that. However, I usually disregard them if there are a lot of good reviews. I understand that a lot of people have trouble installing products such as this.<br><br>I have installed a lot of wireless devices, security cameras, etc. So I figured a lot of the poor reviews didn't pertain to me.<br><br>I took everything out of the box and did an inventory. All was present. I installed the little power box inside my existing doorbell housing. So far so good. I took off my existing doorbell and wired my Ring Doorbell Pro to the existing wires. When I tried to get it to link up with my wireless router I had problems. It seemed logical at the time but I couldn't get a good connection. I have an external wireless extender that I moved to an outlet on the wall very near my front door. Still no luck. I called customer service and they were very courteous and walked me through a reset. I didn't read that there was a reset button but after he had me press it, it went through the setup process again. It worked this time.<br><br>I got it connected and we went out to dinner. I hadn't done much with it yet so I was thrilled that a neighbor happened to stop by. She showed up on the screen and I talked to her. Startled her because she suspected we weren't home. However, as I talked to her I noticed that she had her head leaned right up against the Ring Doorbell. She couldn't hear me unless she did that. I had noticed that when I first set it up it didn't seem very loud. I thought that there might be a volume setting but didn't find one. Luckily we live on a very quiet street. For this first test I was fairly pleased.<br><br>The next day I did some tests with my wife to determine how it worked. I didn't. It appeared to have lost its network connection. I took it apart again, reset it and reconnected it to wireless. Seemed to work.<br><br>When I tested the motion settings, I found that if I had it set at the most sensitive, every car set it off. That was OK. I set it at the lowest setting and it never did detect anything even as my wife walked to the door. I set it in the middle setting. I also started noticing that there was a long delay between when she pressed the bell and when something showed up on my iPhone. Some of the time the image showed up and sometimes a still image was visible and the audio was garbled. It seemed that if I went back later and looked at the video, sometimes a better version played back compared to what I saw in real time.<br><br>Then I found that the motion sensor didn't work very often. Then I lost Internet connection again and could not get it restored.<br><br>I wrote to Ring listing my problems and asked for help. They wrote back and said I could return it for a full refund. I assumed they would work to keep a sale but I guess not. I sent it back.

1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2020","<span>
  PLEASE PLEASE, do not buy these cameras and the doorbell. I did not listen. Now I am not going to use a lot of big words to describe the problem. I am just going to tell you the truth. I am 70 years old and I purchased these cameras because I live alone and I wanted security. I am not secure and I do not feel secure. I purchased due to all the advertisements and because Shaq endorsed them. They do not work and the customer service really sucks. One day I was put on hold for 45 minutes then hung up on. The supervisors are no help at all. I purchased 3 floodlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera. They all are malfunctioning. The doorbell does not alert until the person is long gone. What is the purpose if the incident is over before you can even see it. Then you cannot even pull the incident up for about 4-5 minutes! You have to wait to see who was at your door and that's not safe. in 4-5 minutes someone could already be in your house!! I have horrible neighbors who are interfering with one of the floodlight cameras and literally making it go off every 1-3 minutes. I've called ring over 52 times since October of 2019. They cannot or will not resolve the issue, other than tell me the camera cannot be tampered with. I KNOW THAT IS NOT CORRECT! If you buy these cameras buy at your own risk. I am here to tell you that they do not work and customer service will not help you when they fail and they will fail!!!! Shame on you Shaq O' Neal. Shame on you Amazon for buying and selling this mess !!!!!!!  On my last recent call to Ring I was told that the cameras do not work in real time. The representatives say whatever they want to try and get you to hang up. I'm 70 not senile. Someone named Richmond told me that! The commercials show the people walking up, you activating the sound and talking to the person. One of My problems is the people are already gone before the camera actually activates. I would look into buying something else if I could afford it. You have a choice. DO NOT BUY RING. Do not be tricked like I was.

  I was in the market for a new video doorbell and was a previous Ring user.<br><br>At one point the original Ring worked great but sadly one of the more recent app updates ruined any reliability that it once had. I can't begin to describe just how frustrating it is to get nonstop notifications of cars passing bye but not a single alert of someone walking up to your front door or catching the back of someone's head as they're walking away but ONLY if they rang the doorbell first.<br><br>I decided to give Ring one more chance after the Pro was on sale during the pre-Prime Day sales. I sure am glad that I did!<br><br>Gone are the days of false alerts and missed visitors. The ability to set your own motion zones is a game changer over the original. With it I am now consistently getting motion notifications only when someone steps on the driveway or walking towards our front door.<br><br>What's great about it is that I no longer gets notified when someone is walking in front of the house or cars driving bye. Such a nice upgrade.<br><br>However, one issue that I wanted to make a note of is that at times the sound can become mumbled and difficult to hear regardless of your WiFi connection/signal strength.

  I had high hopes for this little device, but it just does not perform as it should. The setup is straight forward with no issues. However, live and recorded video is extremely choppy at best.

I even bought a range extender that is perfectly located about 5 feet from the ring pro, but still same results.

The live view function doesn’t work anymore either. It is hard wired so it’s not the battery and I have another doorbell pro and 3 stick up cams that are all still working great so it’s not tge wifi. Simply a lemon! Installed everything in the same day just for reference.

Hopefully it can get replaced and I can ipdate this review.

  Overall it's a pretty great product especially if you're not home a lot and want to see what is going on around your home.  The video quality is average for a wired system, which is very disappointing, but the ease of use and great customer service almost make up for it.<br><br>My first unit stopped being able to show live recordings until they were over.  Reached out to Ring and they determined it was bad.  It was ~8 months old.  They sent a replacement unit that was then also faulty and suffered very poor video quality.  Another call to them and they then shipped me a 2nd replacement unit that is working fine.<br><br> I must say I am highly impressed with Rings commitment to fixing the issue.  A dedicated rep emailed me and worked with me through the entire case until my issues were resolved and I was happy.

1.0 out of 5 stars,The TV ads are just bait. Not reality.,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2020","<span>
  TL:DR While initially innovative, I find nothing now to clearly distinguish it (I feel competitors have caught up on features and I don't like its many delays and 100% dependence on the cloud) and have had too many hardware failures for its price point.<br><br>Since I have no real experience with any other video doorbell, I can only gauge my experience against their ads and they FAIL COMPLETELY to live up to the promise. Isn't that always the way with marketing.<br><br>Updated: After my previous 1-star review, Ring Customer support reached out to help me solve ""my problem."" I don't have a problem; their hardware and software are poor. I've decided to rewrite the review to be more clear there are hardware AND software problems. And this product has been out long enough to gets these bugs sorted out.<br><br>I've now ordered my 3rd Ring Doorbell Pro. They seem to last a year or so before failing; ordered 1st one on 6/14/17 and second on 12/26/18 and I just ordered my 3rd one 7/2020. Getting to be expensive. In the time I've gone through now 3 Ring Doorbells I still have my first Nest thermostat. I'm guessing Ring Doorbell Pro has a thermal design issue that leads to premature failures since video camera sensors can run hot.<br><br>And to get the first one working, I have replaced the doorbell transformer (indeed as one reviewer said you can't buy one at the local hardware store but must order from them since its a 30vac model and I had a 10vac), removed prior old doorbell chimes in place of the Ring Chime (now have 2), and I'm now mounting the new Ring Doorbell Pro on a heatsink in case it's getting too hot mounted on a wood block. And we don't even have the really HOT weather in Chicago. I also had a Ring camera die, so I think their hardware just isn't reliable even though it isn't cheap. I'm also paying the annual subscription for video storage so I get 10% discount buying a replacement (which I did order thru them); but I'd rather they didn't fail. Yes, the subscription extends the warranty, but I want a replacement NOW and not get back to me in 2-3 weeks (as stated on their website). I also expected better access to customer service since I'm an ongoing paying customer. Device heath says good voltage and good WiFi so location isn't the problem. And when the Ring Pro fails, I'm dead-in-the-water since I've removed all the stuff required for the old push-button doorbell.<br><br>Now about the software. The system simply isn't fast enough; better than nothing 3 years ago but I expect faster now. Once (literally once) in 3+ years have I been able to do what is shown in the TV commercials; be eating in a restaurant, get the motion alert, pull up the video, and then converse with the person or yell at the ""thief"". This is mainly because whoever trips the motion alert doesn't wait around for Ring to get its act together.<br><br>In a typical scenario I'll be in my basement working (good WiFi), get a motion alert, try to look (a 20-30 sec delay), and the person is gone. When I go to history to see what triggered the alert (a delivery person on the porch vs someone walking by in the common area of the townhouses) it takes what seems like an eternity (1-2 mins) to start the video (more accurately, the alert shows up in ""history"" but the only thing I can immediately do is delete it; I need to continually try to view it--an obvious fail in the UI design). They don't show that delay in the ads, do they? And the camera lacks any depth perception so I need to set the motion zone to not include the sidewalk or side yard; even in person-only mode still too sensitive. Maybe this would work better if you have the large front yard shown on the TV ad where you can set a large motion zone.<br><br>Once you have the live video feed up, it works nicely with a clear picture, but who watches their front porch 24/7; isn't that the whole point of Ring? Unfortunately, I'm stuck in the Ring ecosystem with door bells and cameras and alarm. It is useful when it works. Nice idea but poorly executed. I'm not pissed enough to scrap close to $800 of hardware and go through the setup for a new system but pissed enough for a 1-star review.

  After reading some of the negative reviews on installation I was prepared for this to take all day. In fact, it took me an easy and stress free 45 minutes. Everything worked first time right out of the box. Some things to note include the fact that I had a old thirty year old Nutone doorbell which was hooked up to an old 30 year old transformer which put out exactly 16 Volts AC. Perfect for this device. Also, my WiFi at my installation point is strong and fast. I did order the accessory which angled the doorbell slightly towards the door so that the view of the person standing at my door was visible.  Also, I reviewed the installation instructions before I started the process at my wife’s request. Once again, she was correct. Using the instructions really did make the process easier as less stressful despite my tendency to want to tough it out with no instructions. The video instructions are not exactly correct only because they made some slight improvement in the wiring harness. There are a couple of wires that they told you to add which were already added. Not a big deal. One last tip, the security screwto affix the fron plate is really small. Put a sheet or something under the device before you try to screw it in so that if you drop it on the ground it can be easily found.

  Horrible experience in multiple ways. Very unreliable video.  Dropped most frames.  Audio choppy too despite 25 ft and 50meg down 5 up  on my iPhone 2 ft. further away from router.  I have 300-400 Mbs on my iPhone up and down and 3 ms latency if close to router so the rest of the network is transparent. Had multiple issues with stalling menu windows waiting to load.  Horrible latency for motion alerts or door button presses if you just use your iPhone as a .  About 7 seconds!  If you have motion and a door bell press the system seems to get backed up and non responsive.  If I press the door bell twice it seems to go into overload.<br><br>Got crazy error message when installed saying everything OK but voltage 3864 mV too low!  For any app to try to tell me it knows my voltage to 4 decimal places is absurd.  For any app to be released allows such sloppiness cries of amateurs. Error went way after a few minutes.<br><br>The documentation is sloppy.  For example the Ring Pro WiFi help page takes you to a page that says it only works on 2.4ghz!  Clearly they forgot to update the pages and/or links for the Pro version.  That leaves me with feeling very uncomfortable about the quality of the product overall if the documentation can't even get simple stuff right yet they clearly spent a huge effort to write it in a glowing patronizing way.  I'd prefer accuracy.<br><br>They insist on your phone number and spin a nice little story of needing it for support.  Problem is you cannot install it without believing their nice little story. AND they insist on an address.  They tell you that it doesn't have to be the right address.  My chime and bell each came up with different wrong GPS address guesses.  Then I was left to puzzle as to wither the wrong addresses have to be the same wrong address or not. No comment from  the manual.<br><br>The chime also was problematic in saying it was connected then immediately getting disconnected and wanting a 15 second reset followed by a full reinstall.  All of this happened after I figured out the blue flashing is impossible to see in a bright room.  Pity their patronizing manual writers didn't mention that that couldn't afford a blue light that works in daylight.<br><br>They went to all the bother to give you a nice little screw driver with two ends and no friction to hold the tip.  The tip falls right out at the slightest incline. It's impossible to find when it bounces into shrubbery by the door.<br><br>So much promise here but not close to being finished

  I decided to try this doorbell after hearing my neighbor’s praise for it and I ended up getting it with part of a security camera installation.  Like anything, there are some pros and cons with the device.<br><br>My two main gripes is that the “pro” version of this doorbell is expensive at 250 dollars, which is in the price range of more feature rich pro grade security cameras.<br><br>Secondly, this doorbell is not ONVIF compliant. Which means that you cannot integrate it into your own security camera system and the doorbell will only work within the Ring system.  The downside of that is that you are limited to having recordings on Ring’s cloud service, which has a monthly cost.  Without the cloud service, this Ring doorbell makes viewing live action the only feature it has.  Once ONVIF compliant camera doorbells with similar quality and features hit the mainstream, Ring might change their tune on this.<br><br>One minor complaint is that the “pro” doorbell does not have any battery backup like the larger Ring 2 and Ring classic does.  This is mainly because this doorbell is slightly slimmer, which I needed for the limited space on my doorframe.  It is still a bit large and long though, which I presume over future generations of the device will get smaller.<br><br>This doorbell includes everything you need for the installation and includes 3 additional faceplates, if you want to change the color, the tools to install, wedge mounts and a backplate for the older devices.  Installation is pretty easy with the excellently written instructions.  The installation for the pro doorbell is a bit more involved than the other Rings as you have to deal with connecting to your doorbell chime’s transformer.  There was a small glitch in my setup as for some reason, the doorbell had an issue with connecting to my internet for some reason.  I have to remove the device from the app and re-add it again before it figured out how to connect.  I presume this was just an isolated issue as it has stayed connected with no issues since.<br><br>Video is pretty good, although it doesn’t match some name brand security cameras.  Speaker sound could be better as it sounds a bit muffled and squawky.  It seems to capture motion pretty well but it can be a bit finicky to adjust and over sensitive at times.  I like the fact that my original doorbell works (although some brands may not work as well, I use a Nu-tone chime) as well as it notifies my phone, which I especially like as my regular doorbell can’t be heard all throughout the house.<br><br>One feature I would like to see added is some type of tamper alarm as recently in our area we have had individuals stealing/removing the doorbells for some reason.  A tamper alarm would be a nice feature to help alert you to this happening in the moment, hopefully helping prevent the theft.  I have never had to test this but, Ring indicates that they will replace it if it stolen.  A tamper alert would help with that and save the manufacturer some cost that would hopefully be passed onto the consumer.<br><br>I have also noticed an occasional rare recording glitch where video is recorded and either goes black or green for a few seconds at a time.  Not exactly sure what causes that, whether it is a wi-fi issue or something with the cloud recording.  It is rare but something that could cause a failure at the wrong time that Ring should look into making more reliable.<br><br>Quality seems pretty decent, but this only has 1-year warranty and it remains to be seen how well this holds up over time.  For the price, this should last several years and I would be disappointed if it doesn’t.  If only they would make an ONVIF version, so that I wouldn’t have to rely on the RING network, make this a bit less expensive and improve the speaker, this would be nearly perfect.<br><br>3.5 stars

  The product works exactly as advertised, easy to install and the first free month trial was great while having access to my recorded 'Rings'. But the product was designed to milk customers like a gym membership you can never get out of, with a $3 or $10 monthly access fee to obtain information from their cloud. Information that could be stored locally on the device and accessed without a service/fee. Although they hit their point for capturing my impulsive purchase, it's now just a normal doorbell that cost $250 with a camera recording feature I don't use, because although $10/mo sounds cheap, cheap adds up over time. It's an indefinite monthly cost that isn't necessary if they instead designed on-board data storage. They stopped short on their design to keep a hand in my wallet.<br><br>And to top it off, once you stop paying for their monthly service, you also loose access to the old videos that were recorded while you were paying a monthly fee. Feels like ""takebacksies"".<br><br>Save your money for the competitor who seizes this opportunity by offering local device video storage without requiring a monthly service fee.

  Since having bought this product I've learned a lot about door bells. Not that there is much but I guess it was something that I didn't know much about. My house is 105 years old and I estimate the doorbell system to be from the 1950's. Removing the original door bell I knew I was in for some real fun wiring this thing into my house. The provided wiring clips are huge for this sort of application. I would Imagine not too many homes have that much space behind their door bells. But hang onto them for a rainy day. Everything you need to install your doorbell is included except for maybe an in-line fuse, electrical tape and/or a 16-24V transformer.<br><br>I followed the included instructions and found that my new doorbell was working great. That was until night came and the night vision lighting kicked on. It looks pretty futuristic which I like but then the camera went offline. I thought maybe I was playing with my new toy too much and killed the battery (no battery. Duh) but instead learned that the camera wasn't getting enough power. I consulted the Ring website to discover that if I have this issue I could try bypassing the included power kit that wires to my door chime. This meant that I lose functionality of my indoor chime (but lucky me Ring sells one I can cover a scare electric outlet with) and I would have to call Ring customer service to order another cable for. I read that this alternative cable is not included with the set to avoid confusion. I can understand that having worked with the public for years on end, but the instructions were delightfully clear and simple. I'm sure Ring could clearly define this cable's use. But as suggested by their website I was not one to wait 7-10 days to use my Ring and followed their direction to build my own.<br>I went to store to store to try to find a 1-Amp in line fuse housing to no avail. Not even at the specialized train shop that knew exactly what I needed but quit carrying them.<br>I found them on Amazon and now I have a lifetime supply of 1-Amp in line fuses for $10. If it weren't weird or creepy as far as logistics are concerned I'd give you all some if you want.<br>I digress, I put my new cable into the chime as instructed. Success! But I was barely getting more power running to the camera and night vision yet again killed it.<br>That's all the help I could find on the website. They do have a handy chat service I used to ask about the wiring of the new power cable I didn't bother to try. Seems like they repeat the website. But I'd rather not talk on the phone either having worked at a call center. I decided to look for answers on Google. Come to find out the root of the problem was the also ancient transformer. Only 10 Volts when the minimum needed is 16. I replaced the transformer and to make up for the old wire I'm running 24v out of the transformer and even with new wiring your doorbell can handle that. I found the transformer in with the door bells at Lowes for about $16. FINALLY I got this thing to work 100% and I love it. I only deduct one star for the auxiliary cable not being included and the app is slow to load more often than not. Also the doorbell experts could recommend a new transformer up front for power issues to save people the hassle.<br>Other than that it's been fun to watch my odd neighbors do their odd things from time to time.<br><br>Overall I would recommend this system. I'm not a fan of the monthly service charge but it's pretty inexpensive if you purchase it for a year. ($30).

2.0 out of 5 stars,... difficult for me to write considering how much I loved the device when it worked,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2017","<span>
  This is difficult for me to write considering how much I loved the device when it worked.  I’m on my second doorbell now, but looks like I will be returning it shortly.  Long story short, the first video doorbell I ordered came defective.  It did not talk to me nor would it appear in my list of WIFI connections on my phone.  After speaking to customer service, which has always been very friendly, they advised me to send it back due to it being defective.  Once the replacement came, I hooked it up and it worked like a champ.  The motion detection, 2-way voice, and video quality exceeded my expectations.  A week later, I got a notice on my phone that it lost the connection to the WIFI.  I followed the instructions to reconnect, but it again would not appear in my list of WIFI connections.  Again, I contacted customer service who walked me through troubleshooting steps and had me reset the device.  It connected, but then instantly disconnected and we have not been able to connect since.  The signal from my router always showed good and the voltage fell within their range.  The rep advised me that they are currently having an issue with devices dropping their connection, but their folks are working on it.  I’m guessing a firmware update is needed.  If it doesn’t come soon, I’m going to return the device, but this time look for a different brand.

  For a relatively mature product, this product lacks finesse in all of its primary scenarios. When I receive a notification on my phone, I’m sometimes not able to view live video. Recordings aren’t available for MINUTES after an event occurs, and there’s no indication of when it will be available—I’m just presented with a 0 second blank download.<br><br>I installed a new Unifi AC Pro 30 feet away from the doorbell and this thing still struggles to get a solid signal. I do live in a city, so wifi interference is common. That said, none of my other outdoor devices have this problem.<br><br>Video quality is meh. I’m not sure you could convict someone based on the footage if they were generic looking. Not to mention that if you’re standing too close to the door, I can only see the midsection of whoever is there.<br><br>Motion detection is OK. No better or worse than most other devices I have. I have a &gt; 50% FP rate, mostly at night, even with the motion detection rate turned down.<br><br>And finally, the doorbell activation has a 4-5 second delay after the button is pressed. What?<br><br>This product has a lot of potential, but like most things these days, they’ve lost sight of fundamentals.<br><br>Updated 11/26/19: I've now had multiple deliveries where I simply could not communicate with the individual at my door. Imagine desperately trying to communicate with the individual on the other side, but the ring device clearly not sharing any of my audio with the other party.<br><br>On what ring would likely call a 'successful' attempt, I was able to actually communicate by mimicking a half-duplex conversation by alternating the speaker mute and microphone mute, but the dance reminds me a bit of a circus act. I don't have the patience to deal with theatrics like this for a $200+ doorbell.<br><br>On another attempt, the stream simply dropped and I received a 'streaming error'. There's no simple way to recover from this--why not just try to reconnect for me? Nope, the only way I was able to restore the stream was by killing the app and restarting it.<br><br>For those keeping score, this means I have a doorbell that FPs on crossing car traffic, takes many seconds to even ring my internal chime and doesn't allow me to communicate with individuals at my door.<br><br>Sadly, my efforts to be green make me reluctant to put this item in the garbage, though it would bring me great satisfaction.  It will live out a lonely life in a drawer until I find the time to put this on craigslist for free. I will not be pursuing anything made by Ring ever again.

  I installed my Ring Video Doorbell Pro this morning and like it just fine so far. If it continues to perform as well over the first couple of hours I have used it I will raise my ranking from 4 Stars our of 5 to 5 Stars out of 5.<br><br>I have a word of warning for prospective buyers. As other posters have noted, a strong WiFi signal is imperative in order for the Ring Video Doorbell Pro to work properly. Otherwise, this device isn't reliable. When I first installed it, I placed a WiFi extender, an Apple AirPort Express, in an outlet close to my front door but still inside my house. I got only a weak signal WiFi, which the Ring App confirmed. Fortunately, I have an electrical outlet on my front porch next to which my video doorbell is installed. Once I placed the WiFi extender in the outside outlet, I started getting a ""Strong"" WiFi signal and all was well. But for the happenstance of the presence of the front porch outlet, however, I am nearly certain that I wouldn't have been able to make the Ring Video Doorbell Pro work for me. Caveat emptor!

  A co-worker of mine had this item and it really worked well for him and his personal set-up. Unfortunately, my situation was quite different. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with this product.<br><br>1) It was a total pain in the butt to install. After MULTIPLE attempts to get it working over half a day and losing my religion, I finally got it to work.<br>2) Connecting to the video from my phone app was laughable. My phone would notify me. By the time you open the phone app, made several clicks, and it connected to the live video, the person was gone or the moment was over. Now my co-worker was able to open his phone app and, boom, he was talking to whomever was at his door. Me? Two minutes later I was connected. Once again, multiple attempts to get the system to work faster, but never figured it out.<br>3) The motion detection was spotty because I park by my front door, so it wouldn't recognize anything beyond my car, only when my car wasn't there. So when I was home, it would only motion detect the five-foot space between my front door and the car. Missed anything else.<br>4) Night vision was awful. You can see the first couple of feet. That's it.<br>5) The doorbell didn't ring some of the time. No rhyme or reason to when it would or would not work.<br>6) The doorbell got direct afternoon sunlight which distorted video and eventually led to its demise. It lasted a year and a half, but the plastic is destroyed from the sun.<br><br>Total waste of money and time. Really, really expensive doorbell that works some of the time.

  I have only had this for two days so far. I know it's short, but I came across a lot of problems already.<br><br>Equipment<br>I was pleasantly surprised that the Ring came with the installation kit. The screwdriver was of high quality! They gave extra screws, anchors, and even cable stuff. I love this type of packaging and thinking. Thank you, Ring, for thinking of those extra steps.<br><br>Installation<br>The installation is very easy. I have a mechanical doorbell and I already know where the transformer box is. I installed the power kit that came with the doorbell easily. Then came the Ring doorbell itself. Unfortunately, whoever did the stucco finish on the outside of my house sucks because the doorbell wall was not even at all. I couldn't just install the Ring doorbell--otherwise it would have been so simple. Since my surface was not flat, I had to purchase some stucco patch and even out the wall. After the stucco patch, I simply attached the two wires to my Ring doorbell and set it up with my Android phone.<br><br>Setup<br>Set up was easy as well. I don't have to do any manual port forwarding configuration changes on my router. I have two routers at home--one downstairs and one upstairs. My doorbell's location happens to get a stronger signal from my upstairs router so I connected it to that. Simple and done! Ring seemed to be working fine.<br><br>-- Problems --<br>Lag Time<br>Like some of the other reviewers have said, there is a 5 second delay to when my mechanical door bell actually makes a sound. That is so bad! I don't want my Amazon delivery people to wait at the door for 5 seconds! What if they leave with my package thinking no one is home?? Then you might think, what about my phone app? Well, the phone app has a lag of 2-3 seconds too. Besides, what if my phone isn't near me when I'm at home; this is when I need to rely on my mechanical doorbell sound...but the 5 second delay is really bad.<br><br>Mechanical Chime<br>Okay, I'm not sure which is worst: the 5 second delay or my original mechanical chime. My mechanical chime used to go ""ding-dong."" Now, it only goes ""dong""...where is my ""ding"" ?!?! What if my phone isn't near me, and I don't hear that ""dong"" ??? I don't know how to fix this issue. I have taken the doorbell off and did the rewiring again just to make sure the contact is there. When I took the Ring off, I took the two wires and made contact with each other only to find out that my mechanical doorbell chime is still okay (it makes the ""ding-dong"" sound even with the power kit installed), but somehow, when the Ring is installed again, the mechanical chime doesn't work as it's supposed to. If anyone has a solution, please let me know. I'm already missing my mechanical chime, and I fear that I might miss some visitors. It's only been my second day with Ring and the UPS man had to bang on the door loudly this morning just to get me to sign my package...<br><br>Network (1)<br>My upstairs router is connected to my Insteon Hub as well for my Insteon plugs and Insteon switches throughout the house. After connecting Ring to my upstairs router, my Insteon Hub stopped working. The light on my Insteon hub was still green and all my switches were working, but my Insteon app and the browser interface could not get the status of my lights and could not control my lights at all. After the first night, I switched the Ring's network to my downstairs network so my Insteon Hub can work again. Once I removed Ring from my upstairs router, my Insteon network worked again! I don't know why Ring and Insteon would have a problem when it's on the same router. I don't have time to figure it out, but after googling, I didn't see anyone else with that problem. I thought it might be some port issue, but I don't think Ring and Insteon uses the same ports.<br><br>Network (2)<br>After connecting Ring to my downstairs router, I left for work...only to find out that Ring had some issues. I always got a black screen on my phone when I'm trying to do a live view. I couldn't even hear any sound. When there was motion or someone at my doorbell, I would get the notification, but I see a black screen. On the Ring website, the videos that were recorded were either black or white. There were a few videos which had real picture and motion; however, only the first 3-4 seconds played the video and then the rest of the recorded video is just frozen. I read other reviews and did some search, then I figured that I'll try a WiFi extender for my downstairs router. I Amazon Now Prime'd a WiFi extender. When I got home from work, I set up the WiFi extender with a different SID (to make sure that Ring would connect to the extender and not the router), and then I set up my Ring again. Ta-da!! No more black screen!! It worked again. So the reviews I read were correct--Ring needs a very strong WiFi signal and connection.<br><br>-- Thoughts and Comments --<br>I'm lazy to return this, and I really like to monitor when my packages arrive so I'm keeping this doorbell (especially when there has been package thieves recently). I hope I can find a solution to the mechanical chime and the lag time. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know.<br><br>The subscription is stupid. It makes things very easy, but what if I don't want to pay $30 a year? What if that $30 subscription fee will increase in the future? Is the cloud safe? Where are my videos located? Where is the data center? Are they using AWS? (Sorry, getting a little geeky/IT right now, but security is always an issue). What if I get hacked?? I wish there was an option to save the video recording to my own local hard drive. Perhaps I should have researched other options. I was too excited and impatient when I saw the youtube videos for Ring so I immediately ordered it out of impulse. Others, please do your research on what's available out there first! Another doorbell I heard of while searching for solutions for my Ring problems was ""SkyBell HD"". Just Google! Good luck!<br><br>=============================================================================================<br>UPDATE -- DAY 3<br>=============================================================================================<br>I'm knocking 1 star off the 3 stars that I initially gave this product.<br><br>This morning at 9am, I found out that the Ring wasn't working because it didn't capture my family member leaving at 6am. I checked my phone app to see a live view. Unfortunately, the app is incapable of telling you whether the Ring doorbell is connected/powered on/powered off. This is an important feature that needs to be implemented. I had to go downstairs and physically check the Ring. I pressed the button, but nothing happened. The Ring lost power! Why? I have no idea.<br><br>I removed the face plate and tried pressing the setup button--nothing. I unscrewed the Ring and checked the wires. The wires were still intact. I took one wire off and probed it on the second wire/screw to make contact. My mechanical chime was working fine! I put the first wire back on, but the Ring did not turn on. I unscrewed both wires and then screwed them back on, and the Ring powered on again with my previous settings.<br><br>What??? Why did the Ring lose power anyway? Why did I have to remove both wires and screw them back on!? Do I have to do this every morning?? I guess we'll see.<br><br>So back to the feature I was talking about. They really need this feature. If your Ring doorbell is off, stolen, or disconnected from the internet, you have to figure it out on your own because when you try to do a live view from the app, it just shows a black screen. So how do you know if it's a power issue or an internet issue? They need something to detect this so you can troubleshoot the issue more easily. I should have been able to tell that it was power issue this morning and not internet.<br><br>=============================================================================================<br>UPDATE -- DAY 4<br>=============================================================================================<br>This morning, I found that the Ring has no power once again. The last activity I got was 10PM of the night before, but I did not see my family memeber leave at 5AM again. This means that the Ring lost power between 10PM and 5AM, and I still don't know why.<br><br>I disconnected one wire and reconnected it. By doing that, the Ring powered on to normal again. I don't want to do this every morning, and what if there is some suspicious activity between 10PM and 5AM?<br><br>I will have to contact a customer representative (thankfully, someone has commented with that info--thank you, Kandyce) and see what can be done to fix this. I will update later.<br><br>=============================================================================================<br>UPDATE -- 10/10/2016<br>=============================================================================================<br>My issue has been fixed. A customer representative (Kandyce) had commented on this review and offered help. I contacted her by email, and she immediately responded. She forwarded my issues and concerns to her technical team which called me.<br><br>I scheduled an ""appointment"" the next day for the team to call me in the morning. When the person called me, she restated the issues I had, and then asked me to do a couple of things. Here are the things she asked me to do:<br>* disconnect the power kit from the power kit from the door bell transformer and reconnect the original wires<br>* try to ring the Ring Pro<br><br>Somehow, she diagnosed that the transformer in my house isn't giving enough power to my Ring Pro so she said that she will send another power kit along with a Ring chime and that it should fix my issue.<br><br>When the new power kit and Ring chime arrived, I installed it and the Ring Pro worked perfectly. It didn't power off anymore. Unfortunately, I cannot use my mechanical chime anymore and will have to rely on the Ring Chime. I say ""unfortunately"" because I do like the traditional door bell sound and I am afraid to completely rely on the network and Wi-Fi; however, it is a cost of using Ring Pro. I prefer to have the Ring Pro as  part of a security system so I have no other choice.<br><br>Since it took a week to two weeks to fix the issue, I did ask for an extension on the free cloud trial since I didn't really get to use it, and fortunately, Kandyce was able to do that.<br><br>I changed my review to 4 stars because of the superb customer service Ring has provided and especially since my Ring Pro is working fine now. Kandyce and her team were very patient and helpful when I'm asking for help. Kandyce even did a follow up to make sure everything is alright.<br><br>Good business, but the product could definitely make some improvements.<br><br>Some of the things I would like to see in future updates:<br>* ability to save videos in personal cloud storage (not using their service)<br>* ability to see if the Ring Doorbell or Ring Chime is offline/online (maybe network might be down)<br>* less black screen while doing a live view or answering a ring when I'm not home<br>* ability to change the chime on Ring Chime

  OK, I just had the device installed today, and I couldn't be more impressed. Now, I've read the reviews that talk about the device dying after a short period of time, and obviously, I'm in no position to address that concern. At first glance, however, this is dazzling technology. It took a while to set up. I had initial problems that were immediately addressed by telephone support that answered within a few minutes. It turns out that my device was simply charging the internal battery and therefore the setup was erratic. Once charged, no problems.<br><br>Now on the the accolades. I have yet to find any feature of this device that is not modifiable or adjustable. You can control the field monitored for motion, you can adjust the motion sensitivity, you can customize the alerts you receive, you can monitor the status of every feature of the device and its connectivity. And yes, it links to Alexa. I'm a bit of a ""techie"" and I've put this thing through its paces. I have yet to discover anything reasonable the device will not do.<br><br>I had feared  that the Ring Doorbell, being ""clunkier"" than the doorbell it replaced, would be a blight on our attractive entryway. But no, the device comes with various covers, at least one of which should blend in with any facade.<br><br>As our doorbell is quite a bit to the side of our front door, directly behind a pillar, I feared i would have to settle for a limited  view of our front porch. Such is not the case. The Doorbell Pro comes with an ample supply of mounts that allow the device to be installed at an angle. The view afforded by mine is more than ample.<br><br>So in short, I am thrilled. The Doorbell Pro is, at  least for today, so much more than advertised. And though I cannot vouch for its longevity, I can vouch for the easy accessibility of tech support.

  I purchased this unit as a doorbell for our residential elevator. Combined with a Kevo electronic lot, when a guest arrives, he or she presses the ring doorbell. My wife and I are alerted on our iPhones. We can see the guest and communicate two way audio. So, we can explain to call the elevator, select the third floor and, voila! they arrive in our living room.<br><br>But, wait, there's more. You can set customized monitoring zones and automatically receiver alerts on your smart phone whenever someone is detected within that zone. So, the device provides the elements of a home security system. For an optional annual fee ($30 for one device; or $100 fore multiple devices) recordings of activity will be saved to Ring's cloud site for 60 days. So, you can see missed callers and all motion activity within the range of the motion detection, including potentially nefarious activity.<br><br>But wait, there's more. You can set up neighborhood alerts that will communicate potential crime activity in a geographical radius that you chose in the set up.<br><br>But wait, there's more. You can even link the device with other Home automation devices, such as Kevo and Wemo.<br><br>I've got to say, the whole experience is so slick that I'm thinking about adding a Ring Pro to our front door.<br><br>(Note: set up was a bit of a hassle. The device didn't immediately respond to the setup guidelines. I called Ring for support, which was both quick and helpful. After troubleshooting options were exhausted, the support person arranged to send out a replacement unit. A couple of hours later, I found that the unit had properly reverted to setup mode. It's when the unneeded replacement arrived that I decided to consider keeping it for my front doorbell.)<br><br>Followup on December 3, 2017: I liked my first Ring Doorbell Pro so much I purchased a second one when it came on Amazon at a $50 discount.  I've downgraded my review from its original five stars not because of any dissatisfaction with the doorbell.  However, the installation was more difficult with the second one.  I had installed the first in new construction, which, in my case, was much easier than a retro<br>I ran into two problems.  First, it turns out that the transformer on our 1973-built home was only 5 volts.  The Ring Pro requires a minimum of 16 volts, which is the more common standard. To it's credit, the Ring app provides the ability to check the voltage, so the problem was diagnosed quickly.  After a quick trip to the hardware store and $18, I purchased a replacement transformer. But it proved tricky to install in a tight crawlspace and required some specialized electrician's tools, which I fortunately have. My second problem was that the leads to the existing doorbell button were extremely short.  Although Ring provides a kit for the problem, it didn't work in my case because the existing switch installation didn't provide room to hide the hardware that's included with the leads.<br><br>The step-by-step installation instructions are clear, and the doorbell and app literally talk one through the installation process.  But I suspect that most people aren't as handy as I am and may find that they will need a professional installer, especially for retrofit installations.<br><br>In my case, I rate the Ring Doorbell Pro five stars, but three for ease of installation, and four stars overall.<br><br>Update: I've had to replace one Video Pro once and the second one three times when they stopped working.  Fortunately, Ring sent replacements under warranty.  The first replacement apparently was caused by an automatic software update that resulted in both units completely failing.  For the second replacements, one of my Video Pros just quit working.  But since support was so good, and replacements were provided at no cost. I still give this product 4 stars.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Great images - annoying implementation,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2020","<span>
  The images from this camera seem very sharp, and the night vision is pretty good overall, though as with all night vision optics, a bright light pretty much washes everything out.  I almost gave this 2 stars because of the issues I'll list below, but the Ring Pro does do some things well enough to come in as ""average"".<br><br>Let's start with the good.  Installation was fairly easy, and it successfully operates my existing chime using the supplied transformer.  The transformer easily mounted inside the existing chime case, so both my phone/iPad and indoor chime ring when the doorbell is pressed.  The Pro didn't seem to want to connect to my 5GHz wi-fi, which may have been because of the hidden SSID, but it connected fairly quickly to the 2.4.  The images seem very sharp and the microphone is very sensitive, so you can often hear conversation out in the yard.  Since it's connected to my existing chime, there are no battery issues to worry about.  I like that you can customize multiple motion detection zones, and it has detected motion out at the end of my driveway (40-50 feet away).  When it detects motion, it captures several seconds of video from before the motion was detected (most of the time), which can be helpful when checking to see what caused the alert.  I did sign up for the storage plan, which was well worth the money for my needs.<br><br>Now the weak/bad stuff.  A couple of the minor annoyances are fairly well documented, such as the delay getting an image when responding to a ring or motion alert.  I have very good (and fast) internet service and very reliable wi-fi, so I've already eliminated those as issues by checking my internet access on other apps while waiting for the Ring app to show me an image.  Also, as previously documented, even if you immediately respond to the alert, by the time you get an image (if you get an image), whatever created the motion has moved on.  Then you have to wait for ring.com to process the video that created the alert before you can see what actually happened.  That wait can be a minute or two minimum, which feels like forever in today's technology.  In about 10 percent of the alerts that I respond to immediately, it will hang on the ""activating device"" screen which I have to exit because if it doesn't come up right away, it basically doesn't come up.  I've waited up to 3 minutes with no result.  But if I drop out of the ""activating device"" screen and immediately go to the live view, I get an image almost immediately.<br><br>But the huge problem is the manner in which motion is detected.  It simply uses light changes as an indicator of motion, not actual motion.  This causes tons of false motion alerts despite my having configured very narrow motion detection zones.  I live in a cul-de-sac and my front door faces west.  At night, any car circling the cul-de-sac that casts light into my yard is getting picked up as motion.  Even worse, I have a flag mounted on my porch, and in the afternoon it casts shadows in my motion detection zone.  On windy days I get more than 20 false motion alerts which I have to 1) wait for processing, then 2) review to see if anything actually happened, then 3) delete the video.  I received over 7 just while typing this review.  While you can ""snooze"" the motion alerts, that just shuts down the notification; it still captures the video which you have to go back a review/delete at some point.  For $200, I expected a stronger implementation of motion detection.<br><br>There are several other minor improvements I'd like to see for a $200 price tag. First, the mounting wedges that are supplied don't give you enough tilt to capture things left within about 2 feet of the camera location.  I'm using both the side and vertical wedges, but the camera cannot see about 1/3 of my fairly small porch area, and that area is where a lot of packages get left.  Next, while the microphone on the doorbell is very sensitive, it is frequently overdriven by anything loud, or strong winds.  It would be nice to have a setting to reduce the sensitivity of the mic since the overdrive tends to cut out the audio in the playback.  And as others have suggested, it would be nice to have the ability to use my local network storage as a buffer for quicker response time and as a fallback for if my internet is out.  I'd be happy to pay a couple of bucks for something that would use my local storage, but I doubt Ring wants that since it would compete with their storage plan.<br><br>The app has a few issues, as well.  When you get the enormous number of false motion alerts, you have to let each one play to make sure it's not valid, then either delete it manually or wait until you've reviewed them all and use the edit feature to select the ones to delete.  With so many false alerts, it would be nice to be able to mark the video as ""keep"" while viewing, then have that indicator show on the list.  This would make it easy to select all the worthless ones in one big delete operation.  I have seen a number of app updates, so they do work on their code, but a lot of what I see is to handle additional devices or features I am not using.<br><br>So as you can see, I struggled with 2 vs 3 stars.  I resolved to 3 because the device does work pretty well for the basics, but it is far from reaching its potential for $200.  I have no problem saying this is a viable device, but don't expect the experience you see in the commercials on a consistent basis.

  Spent 2 hours on the phone to tech support and this will not keep the connection to my wifi. I have an extender and it wants to switch between the extender and the router and will not hold either one. There is no where in the software settings for this Ring Doorbell to say ""remember this connection"" so each time it loses the connection it just drops it completely and won't even remember the password so I have to look up the password and put it in again. Their tech person wanted us to completely re-arrange our network. But all of our phone works on the network as it is and my kindle and my computers all work on it. Just the Ring does not work! The entire setup for this doorbell and the software is not used friendly in any way. My husband is busy as I write this packing it up to return.<br><br>The video portion of our Ring also failed to work because Ring also did not send us all the parts to hook it up.

  Update 12-10-18: Great customer support from Ring. They replaced the dead unit and were available for assistance. New unit is working well.<br><br> Ring video Doorbell Pro stopped powering up within two years of installation. This is a known problem, likely due to the internal battery (yes, there is one in the Pro) and/or capacitor failure; these parts are not user-serviceable. There are many sites/threads covering this issue. I'm leaving the Ring ecosystem and will purchase future devices from the company that rhymes with 'best'.

  I have 2 Ring Flood lights, 1 Stick-on wired Ring camera, and this Ring Door Bell Pro, all are on the eero mesh network on a Verizon Fios Gigabit plan. The other 3 Ring products, although have their own quirks, maintained steady connection to the wifi and no issues with transmitting images so far.<br><br>Both my original and then the Amazon replacement Ring Pro have exact same issue: they would setup fine initially, both worked for a few hours, then both disconnect from the network, and cannot be brought back onto the network, regardless of the reset procedure. I tried holding the reset button for 30 seconds, disconnect from power completely, removed from account and restart, neither would go into the ""white Ring"" mode for reconnection.<br>The first remained in the blinking blue state, the second has no light at all, but in both cases, no connection or ability to enter setup mode. Remember that the other 3 Ring cameras remained fully functional, so it is definitely not the network or user error.<br><br>Also, the various types of Ring products may have similar UI, but they all definitely different SW and firmware, so my guess is the SW/FW is the source of this bug. This appears to be a common problem upon a quick reddit search, but does not seem to have a solution, so back to Amazon.<br><br>Also, my overall complaint about Ring product is that you can only display ""real Live"" feed from 1 camera at a time, and even that gets disrupted and cut off every 20 mins or so.  So it is not a good choice if you want ""Home Surveillance"" with multiple cameras, it only functions as an ""Motion Detection Video"" that allows closer look via ""live view"" for a limited duration. so choose carefully depending on your needs.

5.0 out of 5 stars,This is about using ring Pro with Phonak Audéo hearing aids,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2020","<span>
  SETUP: Ring Pro doorbell and Phonak Audéo M90 RT hearing aids (HAs) connected to the Ring app on the iPhone with Bluetooth.  WiFi range extender near the front door yields a strong WiFi signal to Ring doorbell.<br><br>RESULT: as soon as the doorbell detects motion, I get a tinkling sound through my HAs, much like the angel getting his wings [see “Every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings” (from ‘‘It’s a Wonderful Life’’ 1946)]. Very pleasant. When somebody actually rings the doorbell, there is a distinct sound (hard to describe, but unmistakeable)in my HAs. The physical house doorbell also rings, of course.<br><br>To go one step further, today I was perhaps 10 miles from home, and the angel got his wings a few times:😎:. I could then observe the action at my doorbell over the iPhone.  This, of course is an advertised feature of the Ring doorbell. I only observed motion, not somebody ringing my doorbell, so I cannot comment on speech recognition at the door.<br><br>DOWNSIDE: I can talk on the iPhone through my Phonak HAs, and the other party on the phone conversation can understand me OK, though not as well, perhaps, as if I were speaking directly into the iPhone. However, when I try to speak through the Ring Pro using the mic in my HAs, the party at the door finds my speech unintelligible. If I disconnect the HAs from the iPhone and use the iPhone's mic, the party at the door can understand what I am saying with no trouble at all. But then, of course, I lose the ability to hear the doorbell with my HAs. Life ain’t totally perfect, I guess.<br><br>ADDED BONUS: I can tell my Echo Shows ""Show Front Door,"" and I can monitor the front door visually.  That's neat!  I have not yet been able to try conversing through the Ring with my Echo Show.  Looking forward to trying that.

  I had to return my 1st Ring Video Doorbell Pro hardwired due to Wi-Fi connectivity problems, video skipping or buffing along slowly; the static during two-way talking didn’t allow the person outside to hear to understand what was said &amp; the high pitch scratching sounds on the phone were awful. Several calls for assistance and Level 2 IT really tired to resolve the issues and tried to convince me the problems could be my Router, the modem, the speed and/or computer malware exposure. My advise was to IT was this is Ring’s hardware issues. Had 16 VAC transformer installed. Now the 2nd Pro hardwired: Wi-Fi connectivity’s good, static is 10% less, still unacceptable, 2nd 16 VAC was installed, added 2 wedge &amp; corner kits (will need longer nails) to see the floor at the bottom of the double doors for packages delivery. Still unable to see packages after delivered. Night vision fair. Positives: excellent video, connects to wireless doorbell chime since doorbell doesn’t work anymore, motion detection is more than 30 feet, motion options for different area coverage &amp; day/time options to disarm if busy outside or want to turn off for a time period; allows me and family members away to check surrounding. The concept is great but reading the Bloggers since 2016 they had the same Wi-Fi &amp; static problems. These problems should have been resolved by now. Spent additional money on wireless doorbell chime, two transformer installation, purchased extra wedge, motion light to improve night vision video and spent more than 5 hours on the phone for assistance. Spouse wants to keep this defective product. I wouldn’t recommend this product.

  1) You will need a PRO ringer - unless you have a WiFi repeater right next to it.  It's ability to pick up a WiFi signal is only about 10' or so.  I have 2 routers in my house and it claimed very poor signal from either (yet my cell showed strong signal on WiFi).  ....and it stuttered...until I bought a pro-ringer and ran an extension into the foyer so it could be within 10' of it.  2) you will need to careful set up the motion detection...otherwise a tree blowing in the wind sets it off.  Or a bird flying by.  3) If your existing doorbell is already there - forget about tying this into it unless you are a closet electronics junky and want to experiment with power relays.  Simply put - incompatible with anything you buy at HomeDepot or Lowes.  The supposed adapter they send simply causes doorbell to ring non-stop.  4) By a 16.5V/40W ELK plug-in adapter and simply plug into the wall.  Your normal transformer is worthless and the power adapters for this are a joke.  5) you need an angled bracket unless your sidewalk is straight/perpendicular to your house and not parallel to it.  Once working though, it will be like the first time you WiFi enabled the garage doors - you will wonder why you didn't do it earlier.  Needs work though.  A better one would have 2 cameras - one aimed down so you can see when UPS/Amazon just dumps stuff at your door.  You can get wedges to aim this down....but then you can't see who is at the door.

  I live in an urban area of a major metropolitan city that despite being a ""good"" area with million dollar homes, we are a target for car break-ins and package thiefs.  We tried an Arlo camera system and it sucks for us.  I hate it, I hate their app, it never seems to work when you need it on, and the features just do NOT work.<br><br>I've wanted a Ring doorbell for a while but we have an added difficulty -  our entryway is protected by a metal security gate and the doorbell is built into the metal.  I gave up thinking we could get a Ring doorbell - and then it went on super sale.  You Tube to the rescue!!  I wanted to see if it actually would be possible to get one and make it work for us.<br> I watched a few installation videos to put these onto unconventional surfaces and decided to go for it.<br><br>I was not prepared for how user-friendly and step by step the instructions were to hard-wire this into my existing electrical, but it was EASY.  Like, you really can't mess it up.  There are 2 wires, you don't have to care what the wires do, you just connect them to the 2 screws where it tells you on the very easy instructions.<br><br>Mounting was the challenge for me because I can't drill into the metal security gate, but I saw a video where a dude used heavy-duty all weather outdoor 3M 2 sided tape and it works!  The tape attached this very, very securely.  I mean, if someone is going to want to steal this doorbell, I'm not sure 2 little screws would save it any better then the tape.<br><br>The Ring app is very user friendly and getting the doorbell online was a breeze.  The video is sharp, clear and over my internet only has about a 1 second delay (for contrast - the stupid Arlo cameras have 10 seconds or more of a delay, the video is choppy and not nearly as clear).<br><br>I'm such a huge fan I just bought the Ring security system, which I am also in super love with.  I can't wait to replace the stupid Arlo cameras with Ring cameras (which will be my next major purchase).

  I am really liking the Doorbell Pro so far. The motion detection is pretty good, although even when I set it to People only detection, I still get false positives occasionally when the wind is blowing the tree branches around in front of my door or the sun comes out from behind the clouds and causes the lighting to change quickly, creating shadows.<br><br>Prior to setting the motion detection to people only, and just on the 2nd most restrictive setting, it was still picking up squirrels, cats, and other animals that ran across my porch. It also picked up delivery people from a fairly good distance away as they walked across my front yard toward the house. It seems to me the video recording starts a second or two before the motion detection should have picked something up as sometimes when I go to review a motion detection alert, I see nothing on the video for the first second or so and then see an animal come into view.<br><br>The only hard part of the install was the fact that there was 4 inches of brick to the left of where the old doorbell was positioned, otherwise the wiring itself was super easy and seems improved when I compare what I got to older Doorbell Pro install videos. There aren't any mount extenders that just go straight out, only the angled ones, so I had to get a block of wood and cut it to size and drilling a hole through it to turn it into an extension before mounting the doorbell on that to get it past the brick. Now it has a perfect view of the front.<br><br>The doorbell and motion notifications across all my Echo devices were near instantaneous and only a lagged by a second on my cell phone.

  When someone buys an item like the Ring Doorbell one should remember that all houses are different and all locations have different wifi strength. This is not a Ring product problem. I was with the same customer service representative  for almost 2 months. The fact that I am 70+ years old and just purchased my first smartphone didn't help matters either. This two months included the time sending items back for exchange and waiting for an electrician. Ring helped me with every issue I was having and did not give up. I tried sending back items for the same type to insure it wasn't a product issue. I ended up changing to a different wifi network and adding a couple of wifi extenders to get everything up and running. I live in the rural part of my state where signals for a smartphone or wireless devices can be challenging to say the least. I still have a small issue with an echo on the doorbell  however that is only an issue with my Samsung S10+ not my Samsung tablet or my Amazon Echo Show 2nd generation. from what I understand Ring is working on that. That is why I give Ring 5 out of 5 . Nothing in this world is perfect and no location is the same. Their customer service is the best I have ever experienced. I would mention the customer service representative name however I am sure Ring  management knows it if for no other reason that the time he spent workin with me to get it all up &amp; running. This is about the longest review I have ever left on a product or a company but I felt that Ring deserves it.

  The support has been hit or miss.<br><br>The Ring worked for less than the trial period of their services.  During the time the device worked, I was unable to adjust the sensitivity to a place where it would pickup just the front yard, it continued to pickup traffic even after adjusting the zones in the app... Just not as frequently.  The picture quality was sufficient, but I don't think it's good enough to recognize a criminal walking up the sidewalk or make out the tag on a car driving away.<br><br>Ring support was unable to troubleshoot and advised that I request a replacement.  Hopefully the replacement works.  In the meantime, my experience has been less than positive.<br><br>I setup the Ring at my parents house since they wanted additional security, and a few days before the end of the trial period the device suddenly stopped working.  I called support and advised them of the issues the camera was having.  Their explanation was that it sounded like the camera wasn't getting enough power and requested photos of my transformer.  I got photos of the transformer, but the transformer didn't have the information they needed.  So my father replaced the transformer with the proper transformer, and then it wouldn't turn on.<br><br>My parents are not tech savvy.  The setup has been less than pleasant and I'm not even the end user.<br> Even if the replacement works, I don't think I'd recommend any smart doorbell to anyone who is not tech savvy.  In my opinion, tech should compliment and have minimal impact on day-to-day life, which training and troubleshooting this device has been too disruptive.

  I like this doorbell, but there's a glitch somewhere. It works well, I can see the video but once there is ""motion"" i will pull my phone up right away and it's ""thinking"" 90% of the time and i have to close the feed and open a live feed. This sucks sometimes because I want to see who is at my door right then or what happened on my property and I cannot see it. If the doorbell is rung, I can't see right away what is going on. I can open a live feed quickly, but to ""answer"" a motion or ring call, it won't pick it up quickly. I'm usually at work in the room with wifi or at home and the wifi is within 30 ft of where I'm at usually. We do pay the $30 a year charge to be able to look back on camera; to me,  it's worth it. That's what....2-3 stops at McDonald's or coffee shop a year??? Think of it that way rather than, ""I have to pay to have service"". The other annoying thing is that sometimes, I get a notification when the camera switches from night mode to daytime due to the camera sensing something, so there's nothing on camera but the light change.<br><br>* I hope my review was helpful in your decision.

  I have a Tracfone Alcatel A564C Android 4.4.2. Google Play Store would not install the app probably because of the android version. I have a 2017 Amazon Fire 10"" tablet that accepted the app so I used the Fire. After installing a new transformer on the line to my chimes/doorbell and inserting the fuse as directed, I attached the Ring Pro doorbell and pushed the button. My doorbell rang better than before. The white (light blue?) circle began to spin and I went to my Fire to do the setup. I have a Linksys WRT3200ACM router (WPA2 Personal Encryption), DHCP on. I tried the login to the router with no advanced settings and with advanced settings. (The Ring expert said this setting probably didn't cause my problems.) What happened - the connection to the doorbell was successfully accomplished and I input the password to the router. I received an immediate notice that the Setup Failed. The white circle continued to spin, I told the software, and it went back a couple of steps and tried again. I spent a long time with the experts at Ring with no change in this instantaneous ""Setup Failed"" result.  I requested a replacement from Amazon and while I waited for it, I continued to try everything. I bought a ring plug-in transformer with the same result. I changed the router password to all little characters (no caps, no nums, no special characters). I tried some other router changes. I swapped in an old Cisco E4200 router. Same result. The replacement came and was an already opened box item. (seal broken, plastic wrapping on doorbell missing, etc.) I hoped someone had just tested it before it went out. But no, this one would not even power up at all. This has been a miserable experience especially the opened dead replacement. The bright exception were the Ring experts who patiently tried to help me when I called. That part was, perhaps, the best experience I have experienced with call-in help lines.<br><br>I have never had trouble connecting to either of the routers I mentioned. Was it the app running on the Fire instead of a regular phone android? Was it the router? Was the doorbell's wifi defective or incompatible with my router? I really wanted this doorbell but would I get one like the last replacement which was, pre=opened and DOA? I guess if all my troubleshooting left me not knowing if it was my Fire android, my routers or the doorbell that was the problem, perhaps I should give up.

  Well my first impression with Ring hasn’t been that great. I was so excited to get it installed and start using it. Unfortunately that was not the case. We installed the ring and the power wouldn’t come on. I contacted ring and they told me I had to make sure I had at least a 16 vac transformer. I checked and I did. Then they told me it was probably too old and not putting out enough power. So I went and bought a 24 vac transformer. Installed it and the power still didn’t work. Contacted ring again and she told me to wait 30 to 45 minutes for the battery inside to charge. There is a sticker on it that says you may have to wait a few minutes. To me a few minutes is not 45 minutes. So I waited an hour and it still wasn’t powering up. Then I started google searching and saw where some people had to wait hours for it to power on. So we went to bed, woke up the next day and it still wasn’t working. I ran some errands and came back and it finally started working. So beware, you might have to wait almost 24 hours before it starts working. Once it does start it works great, so far.

  The installation was straightforward and the doorbell works. I used an angle kit (30 degrees) and the field of view is pretty good (my wired doorbell sits perpendicular to my front door). The app looks nice but it and the camera have some issues:<br><br>1) there is no time stamp in the video. All my other camera products, even those costing 1/10th the price, have embedded time. It should at least be an option. The time appears next to the video menu item only and this is inadequate. Try submitting a clip to the police and the first thing they’ll want is the time and date.<br><br>2) the automatic gain / contrast is not too good. I have good color and clarity of my doorstep but the street and sidewalk are totally washed out if it’s at all sunny. This makes identifying individuals or cars impossible at that distance.<br><br>3) retrieving your motions or rings when you have poor cellular service is just awful. When you get a motion alarm you want to see the cause immediately, not download a minute long full res video until it finally gets around to showing you the cause. If you’re traveling (or just anywhere service is poor) this is a showstopper. They should give you an immediate still of the person or a reduced resolution preview so you can see what’s going on right away. The notion of actually talking to a delivery person or anyone else is out of the question. I have a very cheap Sricam watching my back yard which is much more responsive.<br><br>So overall Ring is decent, but I may keep looking around.

  My house I just bought was built in 1973 and the doorbells power is not tied to the breaker of the house. So I literally had the choice of risking frying the stupid thing or shut all the power in my house down, including the pilot for my gas.<br>So I risked it and it seems ok.. But the doorbell doesn't always make the internal chime alert us. Sometimes when it is pressed it reboots itself and then decides to constantly have me reconnect on my app to see the live video.<br>Live feed takes about 2min to actually come up when you're on the go so I miss out on seeing who rung my doorbell. I'm disappointed I can't really stop the motion detecting from detecting my trees moving cause of the wind unless I put the settings to People only but then you miss out on cars parking in front of your house, like I've dealt with so far.<br>I also like that you can try and set a perimeter of where motion triggers the bell to record. Shadows of trees are a bit of an issue too. I love I can share my video recordings easily on the website to my husband or Dad. The delay of when my chime actually rings and someone ringing the doorbell is rather delayed.. Cannot find a way to fix that yet but overall just glad it works right now.<br><br>Overall, I love that there is no contracts and I choose to pay for the monitoring system but the manufacturers don't even think about how older homes are built and thought of a forum to help you install it if your house is older then 1990. I'm not risking my pilot going out for a security system but thank goodness my risk wasn't too bad.<br><br>They also have a big flaw in the production of the doorbell because they only put the stupid setup button on the left. Not every house has their doorbell on the right side. Mine is on the left and the button is smooshed up against a wall thanks to their one track thinking where to put it.<br>Also apparently Alexa doesn't support showing the front doorbell camera on a Alexa device if you ask it like it states it will.

  I really wanted to like this, but after a year of using it, it's generally not a pleasant devise to interact with.<br><br>1) Answering the doorbell is next to impossible. The lag between when the app on my phone connects and when the first doorbell rings is 30-60 seconds, nobody waits around that long after ringing the doorbell.<br><br>2) Motion events take too long to upload to the server and view. Get a motion alert? I have to wait several minutes before I can review the recorded footage of the event, by the time I'm able to view the video, I've often moved on to something else. It is nice reviewing motion alerts later, but realtime (or near realtime) communication/coordination with the Ring doorbell doesn't work reliably enough to count on it.<br><br>3) This unit was hardwired supposed to allow my current doorbell chime to work, it did, but only for about 6 months. Now when users ring my doorbell, the only noise I get is from my mobile phone. This was a big pain in the butt on Halloween, when all I needed the thing to do was operate like a normal doorbell.<br><br>4) Motion alerts don't always work. Very intermittent.<br><br>5) My porch is shaded, and when it's daytime (even on an overcast day), the exposure settings for the camera make seeing faces very difficult.<br><br>My setup is not all that elaborate, my wifi router is 15 feet from the door, but the unit often has connectivity issues with my network.

  I'm not overly thrilled with this product. If you don't have a subscription to RING, it will not show you a video even if something happened a second ago. I had someone ring my doorbell. I got a notification, but it wouldn't connect quickly to the app. Not sure if this was an internet connection gone bad or because of RING itself. (Although I have two other cameras that do the same thing and I don't have issues connecting to them right away when I get notifications.) By the time I was connected to RING, the person had left and there was no recording of them being there that I could see because I didn't have a subscription to RING. I have another camera that gives me 24 hour recordings WITHOUT having to subscribe. This camera also doesn't always record everything either. The other night we had someone at the door at 10pm and 10:30pm, neither of those instances were recorded at all. I'm not sure if it's because it was at night and the night vision wasn't working, but they were AT THE DOOR. It should have recorded, but didn't. Also - if there's motion at the door, sometimes the motion detector doesn't go off right away, it'll sometimes be delayed. I've had someone at the door only for the motion detector to finally go off 10 minutes after they left. I'm not very happy with this product at all. There are ONLY TWO things I LIKE about this product: 1) As long as it's working - the doorbell will go off and you get a notification that someone's at your door - no matter where you are. 2) You can set a range for notifications. So if you have a busy street, you can limit the distance for the notifications so they're not going off all day. (Again - when it's working)

  Like any connected device, it's only as secure as your password, so don't leave it at some default and then act surprised when someone else takes a peek at your porch (horrors!) And if you enable police and community access, well, you asked for it! So if you want it to be private, be smart, ok? Preaching mode off.<br>I'm a techie. I could have installed this thing myself no matter what. Bu WOW was I surprised how easy they made it to install! Any fool can do it in minutes if they follow the video directions on their phone. Maybe that's the problem, people who don't understand the risks of connected devices can install this in spite of not knowing what they're doing. But there I go preaching again. The point is, this works GREAT in every way I wanted, was a dream to install, and has the best deal on on-line monitoring and storage of any video doorbell. They keep improving the app, too. I never want to be without our Ring Pro on the front door.<br>OH, I almost forgot: I had to install it with an old phone that wouldn't run the latest app. No problem, customer service sent me a special link to an older version that would run on my antique phone, no sweat, no arguing, very very nice English-speaking folks to deal with, no pain at all! And now that my 'real' phone is back it works even better, with new features being added from time to time. Great c/s, great tech, great install kit, great app! 5/5 after almost a year in service.

  First couple weeks I didn’t have too many issues. Install easy. App seriously no problem. Only issue I had was when it mattered.<br>Tried uploading video of suspicious individual. Flagged  three times for reasons didn’t know since email response gave nothing than was not a crime. Some on walked up to my door dropped a bag rang door bell, 10 seconds later answered through app with a response of can I help you. Immediately picked up bag and ran away. Email responses still no answer why it was deleted. Disappointed since video and screen shots given to law enforcement to look into this but not good enough for the app to help neighbors or individuals around my area. Cannot believe how much it costs for product plus the monthly cost and when trying to upload something that might help people gets removed?! Oh it’s ok the next 4 uploads were for missing dogs. Makes a lot of sense. Thank you ring for misguided priorities for person and property safety. At least lassie is ok but my house and property is up for grabs.

  Overall a solid piece of equipment that thus far has held up to our Minnesota winter.  I find it has exceptional video quality, but only passable audio quality.  And although it seems to have missed a view apparent proximity alerts (i.e., amazon packages piled up right beneath the doorbell with no historical video to show) - for the most part it's pretty good about reporting activity in a fairly timely manner.  However we bought this primarily with the idea of engaging a caller at the door verbally as an alternative to answering the door.  For that purpose, it's not terribly useful because of the lag between when they ring the doorbell and when you finally have them up on your phone or Amazon echo.  Only incredibly persistent or desperate visitors would be willing to hang around that long.  For our home network, at least, that delay is generally between 1 and 2 minutes.  Rather than returning the unit, I'm holding out for the possibility of a software upgrade/fix that will address this elephant in the room.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Perhaps the best of a mediocre crop of video doorbells...,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2018","<span>
  I purchased my Ring Pro when my parents asked me about a camera solution for their home.  I run a full NVR with IP cams, but that was going to be way too involved for them.  Upon hearing their requirements, it sounded like all they needed was a video doorbell.  While I was passingly familiar with them, I decided to research the various options available.  I settled on the Ring Pro because of the app, the widespread use of the product, and the ability to run with and existing doorbell's transformer and wiring.<br><br>Packaging/Unboxing<br>The packaging is nicely executed.  Everything was present and accounted for, including a tool for installing the Ring.  While it's a nice touch, I would recommend using your own tools to unhook your existing doorbell and attach the Ring.<br><br>Installation<br>Installation consists of opening your existing doorbell chime box and in-lining an included module.  I think it's a flat-pack resistor, but I'm not positive.  In an effort to keep it easy, two wire couplers are included for hookup.  However, due to the small size differential between the chime and the chime box, I barely had enough room to put the module in.  I just soldered the wired and used a tiny bit of heat shrink tubing.  The doorbell switch/camera goes up in a minute or so.  As far as I know, there really isn't a form factor standard for doorbell switches, which was evident when I installed mine.  Due to the differences in length, my door frame required a little bit of putty and paint to be properly finished (YMMV).  There's a small screw that you can use to secure the faceplate to the doorbell unit (since early Ring doorbell models were regularly stolen), but it really wouldn't slow anyone down that wants to take your doorbell.<br><br>Aesthetics<br>The Ring Pro comes with various faceplates, but all of them look kind of cheap.  The silver cover most closely matches the look of my front door hardware, but it would be nice if premium covers (aluminum, brushed nickel, copper, bronze, etc.) were available.  While the Ring Pro is much smaller than a Ring/Ring 2, it's still ginormous.  The projection from the mounting surface is an inch.  While that's clearly stated in the specs, it's another thing to see it in person.<br><br>Setup/Performance<br>The setup procedure on the Ring Pro is straightforward.  In setup mode, the device acts as a wifi access point for your iOS or Android device to connect to.  Once connected, the app will send device the SSID and password you enter.  After a short wait, the device will (hopefully) be connected to the wifi network, and will be reachable through the app.  Performance is a mixed-bag topic with this device, and I suppose it has an awful lot to do with your expectations and use-case.  The first problem is with the wifi - the conditions that the device needs to work in are not the best.  For example, you have doorbell wiring, small packaging (which dictates a small, terrible antenna on the device), whatever materials your house is made of, and any number of other factors.  My wifi performance hopes were not high, but I was still massively disappointed.  When I installed the doorbell, I did not have any wifi signal strength issues at the mounting location (~-50-55 dBm).  However, the doorbell (at the same spot) reported around -73 to -76 dBm.  I could connect to the doorbell at that signal strength, but I could not stream video from it.  I figured I may have a defective device, so I contacted tech support.  They informed me that the range, regardless of band, is not great with this device; they suggested I ""move my router closer"" or use a wifi repeater/extender.  I decided to up my count of Ubiquiti AC-Lite access points from four to five, but that's probably not a realistic option for everyone.  Point-to-point, the closest AP is now about 15 feet away from the doorbell (albeit with the exterior wall separating the two).  The Ring now reports -52 dBm (while my phone reports -34 dBm at the same spot).  Who knows... maybe there are some manufacturing issues with my particular doorbell, but I managed to brute force it into submission.<br>With all of that taken care of, the video stream is now fast and solid.  If there's a problem with the video, it's that the image quality isn't very good.  You can blame the combination of a very wide angle lens with a relatively low resolution (1920x1080) imager.  If you're used to decent quality 3MP+ IP cameras, you are going to be disappointed.  The audio quality in both directions is just ok - expect to have to occasionally repeat yourself.<br>The app is fine, though it does treat Ring sessions as phone calls (on Android, at least).  That has the benefit of being able to use your vehicle's Bluetooth to talk to someone, but it has the downside of 'hijacking' your phone until you end the session - task switching it to the background does not end the session.  The app allows you to turn the mechanical door chime on/off, as well as set the motion detection zones.<br><br>SaaS<br>Ring offers a cloud-based recording option for the device.  If you do not subscribe to this service (which is free for a month, I think), you can only look in on your doorbell and interact with visitors live.  However, if you use the service, you can see video clips of the various events that have happened (rings, motion events, etc.).  I have elected to use my NVR for archival, so I did not sign up for the service when my free trial ended... I would imagine that most users will sign up, though.  The clip functionality is well integrated with the mobile app.<br><br>Conclusion<br>The product is fine, and will probably continue to be very popular.  As it is, I think it's too expensive for the performance you get.  I feel that the ease of installation and the refinement of the app are the Ring Pro's strong points. If you think you have excellent wifi performance at your door, you may have a great experience.  I feel there are multiple enhancements that I'd want at this price point (ONVIF, RTSP, better faceplates, etc.), but none of them were deal breakers.  For any other automation people out there, please note that Ring is supported on IFTTT.

  After lots of reading and a few recommendations from friends that I know who have this product I decided to get one for our home.  Overall this product works as advertised.<br><br>PACKAGING: The packaging for this product was awesome.  Very similar experience to the NEST for those who have them.  It came with everything you need to get up and running right out of the box.<br><br>BUILD QUALITY: Like most new products the build quality of the product is pretty terrible.  I fell like I could crush the entire unit into dust if I squeezed it too hard.  It feels like it's made out of the same plastic as a Happy Meal toy.  However, most new products are built like this nowadays.<br><br>INSTALLATION: The installation is crazy easy.  There are literally two wires that you connect.  I know that some folks are having trouble but anyone who can install a normal doorbell can install this one.  PLEASE NOTE: You must have a STRONG WiFi signal or you will see nothing but a black screen.  If you aren't handy with computer networking then find someone to help you.  I can see where some folks might get hung up.<br><br>RING.COM APPLICATION: The mobile application seems to work the same on both Android and iOS.  Same with the Windows 10 application.  It's well laid out and fairly intuitive to use.<br><br>*MOTION SENSING: This part of the product is absolutely dreadful.  In just about every regard.  Laying out the ""zones"" is terrible.  You get false alarm after false alarm.  Then it doesn't go off when you would expect it to.  Ugh.  This feature needs a LOT of work.<br><br>VIDEO QUALITY: The video quality on this is ""JUST OK"".  There is a pretty wide field of vision which is nice but it's not super clear.  Certainly not what I would have expected from the ""PRO"" version of the product.  Also, there is a fair amount of L-A-G.  We have Charter Spectrum 100 here along with a strong 5Ghz WiFi network.  I even put a wireless extender right inside the door and it's still pretty bad.  Still, it is super convenient when someone comes to your door or if you want to see what's happening outside your house.<br><br>UPDATE 9/22/2016<br>I've had this product now for about 60 days and there are a few additional issues that should be mentioned.<br><br>CONNECTION TIMES / LAG: There is a significant amount of LAG between the time it takes for someone to ring your doorbell and when it actually shows up in the app.  Like 5 to 10 seconds.  As mentioned above we have a 100MB connection with very strong WiFi and it definitely takes a bit of time.  There is also a significant delay when you click the ""Live View"" button on any of the apps.  Don't expect to press a button and look outside LOL.  Be prepared to W A I T.<br><br>VOICE COMMUNICATION: Yes you can speak to the person outside, HOWEVER the quality is horrendous.  You can barely understand them, they can barely understand you.  This feature is almost unusable.<br><br>CLOUD RECORDING: The cloud storage option seemed like a steal at $3/mo HOWEVER please keep in mind that it *only* records actual rings and other events.  This isn't an ""always on"" feature.  Don't expect to go back and review the day's activity outside your home.<br><br>BLACK SCREEN / NO PICTURE: The ""Live View"" will only work in the most optimal of network conditions.  If you don't have a good Internet connection at either your home OR on your device then you just get a black screen.  Keep this in mind when travelling, at work, school, etc.

  We just got and installed the Ring doorbell, this review is just for installation, although I had to give stars for operational features.<br>What's in the box: everything you could possibly need!  I was surprised to find two, yes two wiring harnesses for the special ring power kit.  Then there were some extension wires in case your current doorbell wires were not long enough (mine were not!) and wire nuts.  They even supply extra terminal screws in case you loose one (I never seen that before!).  Also included are the normal brick/cement/stucco fasteners (two different lengths) and different length screws if you use the angle adaptors included.  Also a masonry bit to drill the holes for the fasteners.  I also appreciated the humor in the manual.  Also included is what they call a retro adaptor, and I used that as a template to mark the holes for drilling.  Nice thing about this is it includes a bubble level so your doorbell ends up being level and looks like a professional install job.<br><br>I was also impressed with the help when I called.  I thought my box did not have the power adaptor kit, and called Ring (it was a little difficult finding the number, probably my only complaint).  I didn't have to wait long on hold, and the Ring tech arranged to send a power adaptor.  This was my fault, opening up the other 2nd box in side the box I found the power adaptor.<br><br>Initial impression.  It seems to take about 1 - 2 seconds for the inside mechanical door bell to ring once the button is pressed.  We were getting many motion notifications , mostly for cars in the street, but adjusting the motion zone to not include the street seems to have stopped those.  Although you can supposedly set up to three motion zones, I am personally not sure why you'd need that many.<br><br>Being an optical engineer, seems one could easily have software added to the camera to correct for the barrel aberrations.

  Exactly what was needed to provide another layer of security to my residence. Works great on 5gz wifi (the ring chime pro does work with 5gz, only 2.4) so just make your 5gz router gives a good signal to the front door because you cannot use the ring chime singal booster if it does not. Not a problem at my house.<br><br>I was able to set and name 3 zones to identify motion and set the sensitivity level for detection. I chose to get to notifications when motion is sensed at my front door but you can turn the notification off if you like. $30 a year gets you cloud storage for captured video, you cannot use local storage as far as I know.<br><br>Wiring the power pack into the manual chime power box was extremely easy, 5 minutes tops. Wiring the doorbell and screwing  it in was another 5 minutes.<br><br>I did buy an angle bracket for my ring video pro because my door bell is located on a side wall, not facing straight out. The 20° angle bracket gives me a perfect viewing angle to see my entire door and all avenues of approach to the door.<br><br>Overall, I am very pleased with the Ring Video Pro and have recommended it to my neighbors so we can keep an eye on each other's houses better and monitor unwanted activity in the neighborhood. Along with a security system and motion lights, the Ring Video Pro helps makes my home monitoring more robust.

  The Ring has 99% worked as advertised, has a great image quality on my phone and pretty quick to notify my phone of motion and doorbell ring.  The few hiccups I think are common to video doorbells (occasional network issues) but what makes Ring stand apart is their outstanding customer support.  You talk to a real person that acts genuinely invested in helping to solve your problem.  They gave me their personal contact information and followed up with me.  One time I need a mounting bracket that didn't come with it and they shipped it right away at no charge.  Another time it was my dumb error but they acted like it was their fault and followed up to make sure everything was working right.<br><br>If you're going to invest in technology, you're going to have an issue sooner or later no matter what.  I'm a Ring fan now because I know I won't have to search troubleshooting FAQs, support forums, and Amazon reviews to look for answers to problems.  I know Ring will have my back so I'm happy to give them my money.

  I think Ring makes a excellent product but there are still bugs that need to be worked out.  The doorbell puts out a beautiful Video picture with the capability to talk to the person at the door, and will capture the image within seconds of someone approaching the door through motion detection.  I contacted the support tech team at Ring because I was having issues on occasion connecting my phone to the Ring monitor.  Initially I was sent to a regular tech who was very knowledgeable  about the Ring product and how to trouble shoot.  After about 40 minutes the tech connected me to  a specialist at Ring.  The specialist informed me that they had just downloaded a new software in their system that had some bugs but they were working hard to correct the problem.  They asked me to be patient with Ring product and assured me they would correct the problem.  When working correctly it is amazing!

Before leaving, I had everything operational, had tested it a few times, set the range, sensitivity, and everything. I was pleased at first. By the time I got home, the doorbell unit stopped communicating with a wifi signal. I went through the troubleshooting steps on the APP two to three times, and couldn't get it to work, so I called tech support, spent 20 minutes on hold to get an agent, once she answered she walked me through the troubleshooting steps again, and again they didn't produce a wifi signal to the doorbell. She informed me that I must have received a faulty unit, and advised me to return the unit through my Amazon seller. I told her that it took me over 10 days to receive my initial shipment, and that I wanted the company itself to drop ship me a new device with 2-3 day shipping, or I would go to their competitor (Nest).

  I was looking for a replacement to my rusted doorbell and thought why not one of these more advanced video doorbells compared to the old, existing button doorbell.<br><br>Transformer:<br>I will talk about the transformer since there aren’t too many reviews based on it.  The Ring website states, “Requires a 16-24 VAC transformer.” However, on the technical detail section on Amazon, it states, “Hardwired to existing doorbell systems (16-24 VAC, 30 VA) or powered by Ring Plug-In Adapter.”  The Ring website did not specify the 30 vA requirement while the Amazon detail section did. This made me a bit hesitant on purchasing as my current existing doorbell has a transformer of 16 volts, 10 vA (not the 30 vA listed on Amazon).  I contacted Ring via phone and chat and I was informed that 16 volts, 10 vA should be sufficient but I could only run one Video Doorbell Pro with that transformer since I didn’t have the recommended 16 volts, 30 vA transformer.  I was advised to monitor it for a few weeks. I noticed that the voltage was decreasing from 3984 volts in the Ring app down to 3900 volts (3900 and above is the recommended voltage range). However, upon reaching 3900 volts (or 3898 volts the lowest), it would jump back up to 3980s to 3990s. In terms of functionality, there has been no problem regardless of the drop of voltage. Live views, recordings, motion detection, doorbell ring, etc. worked well throughout the day. I’ve had the device for more than a month now and I stopped worrying and looking at the voltage as it would drop but then increase back up and has been within normal range the entire time since purchase. I called Ring and was subsequently told that since everything is functioning well and has always been within the recommended voltage range, I was told that there is no need to replace the existing 16 volts, 10 vA transformer. If you are planning to install multiple video doorbells, I believe you should get the higher voltage/volt-amps transformer.<br><br>(Note: Finding your doorbell transformer may be a challenge, especially for older homes. You can look first behind the doorbell chime, in a nearby closet, attic, closet of water heater, or basement.)<br><br>Installation:<br>Installation was very easy. They provide all the tools required. You will need to turn off the circuit breaker for the existing doorbell and locate your doorbell chime and attach the Ring Power Kit to the existing doorbell chime.  Then remove the two wires from the existing doorbell and place it on the Ring Doorbell pro.  Just follow the prompts on the Ring app from beginning to end as it guides you throughout the installation process. For proper installation, see their instructions and/or even their video installation instructions on YouTube. I would contact Ring if there are problems as they are always ready to help but for me, there were no issues during the installation. Overall, it was a breeze installing it.<br><br>Videos and Recordings:<br>I have the other Ring cameras and cameras from different brand so this is not my primary video recorder in terms of recording everything. I wanted this primarily as replacement to my regular, doorbell button and to detect and record motions nearby.  I set the motion zones to cover only the driveway up to the door. You can set up to three customizable motion zones, which is very helpful.  You can also set the motion setting to “People Only Mode” if you don’t want too many notifications such as cars passing by. Like the other Ring cameras, there is a Motion Schedule option to alert you with motion alerts based on your schedule.  It has a color night vision, tap camera preview for live view, and audio streaming/recording video setting options that you can toggle on or off.<br><br>An important thing to note is that it requires a $3 per month subscription or $30 a year. However, if you already have the $10/month or $100/year plan for the Ring Alarm, this is basically free as this plan includes professional monitoring, Ring Alarm cellular backup should someone lose electricity, and includes unlimited camera and doorbell cloud recordings.<br><br>Alerts and Notifications:<br>You get instant notification once a motion is detected or the doorbell is pressed.  There are only a few occasions when there is a one second delay of notification when someone pressed the bell but I’m not sure whether it is due to my older phone but in terms of Alexa from Echo Dot or Echo Show announcing, it pretty much notifies me when motion is first detected or doorbell is pressed.  For android, I love how you can customize the notification sounds per device. For instance, you can choose the one that rings like a doorbell followed by a voice saying, “Someone’s at your door” when someone presses the doorbell or “Motion detected at your front door” when a motion is detected via your Doorbell Pro. You can change for each Ring devices such the cameras. For iOS however, I couldn’t find a way to do this so hopefully Apple catches up in terms of customization.<br><br>Ring App<br>I know many people complain about the Ring app. For me, I love it. I love how you can see all your cameras in the dashboard and how it updates after a few seconds so you can quickly glance at your cameras when you are too busy to check out all the recordings.  This for me is a game changing feature. I don’t like other brands whose images of the cameras in the dashboard is just a still photo from who knows when.  There is also the Rapid Ring app the answers the doorbell and cameras or allows you to “live view” much faster than the regular app.<br><br>Echo Dot/Echo Show Integration:<br><br>I love how you can set routines such as Alexa announcing when motion is detected or the doorbell is pressed. This works both on the Echo Dot and Echo Show. You can also customize the light to turn on when the bell is pressed at a certain time frame that you have set.  As stated earlier, Alexa notifies instantly as soon as activities occur, whether someone pressed the doorbell or a motion is detected.<br>My issue is with the Echo Show (in my case, Echo Show 5) where it takes a few seconds before the device shows you who is at the door/answers the doorbell. I wished it was instantly as the when Alexa announces it with the Echo Dot 3rd generation.  It would also be a game changer if there was an option to show/answer the front door as soon as the doorbell is pressed. I believe this is a popular request. Perhaps Ring will make this possible in the future.<br><br>Integration with other Ring Devices:<br>I love how you can integrate the ring devices with each other. You can integrate this with the Ring Alarm so all your cameras will record should the Alarm goes into entry delay or when the alarm goes off. You can also integrate this with their lights such as the pathlights or even their motion sensor. You can also have the other cameras record when the Doorbell Pro detects motion. As mentioned above, you can integrate this with other lights that are non-Ring lights via Routines in the Alexa app.<br><br>Recent Activities:<br><br>I love how you can check the “Recent Activity” and see all the recent activities such as when the doorbell was pressed or missed so you can know when someone has rang your bell or what time a package was delivered assuming the delivery guy actually pressed the doorbell. It’s definitely helpful to know when someone has pressed the doorbell, such as visitors and guests.<br><br>Design/Look:<br>For me, this is the best looking doorbell. There are other doorbells out there that older people may not even think are doorbells since some don’t look like one with their ugly designs. Some also looks like plastic while this one looks class to me. This one for me has the best design.

  UPDATED REVIEW *****<br>After a little over a year, the bell stopped ringing- the camera and sensors still functioned, but when people pressed the button, it would no longer chime. After a LONG call with the technician, it was determined that someone had pressed the button too hard and broken the contact inside. Ring refused to replace the unit. I’m sorry, but even if an overzealous delivery man pressed the button too hard, the unit shouldn’t break so easiy, and the company should be more willing to replace the unit. Now I’m stuck with a $200 doorbell that records video, but doesn’t ring if someone pushes the button!  The $5 doorbell that was originally in place had probably been functioning for 20+ years without a hitch - perhaps Ring should check out the engineering in one of those units and apply it to this overpriced, plastic piece of junk.<br><br>Setup was quite a mystery. I would say that I’m well above average when it comes to DIY, technology etc, but I could not get the device to power up. I replaced the transformer, checked the wiring, checked the connections at the bell, re-checked the wiring, completely uninstalled it, re-installed it, checked every connection with a voltmeter.... And throughout this multi-night process, I spent hours researching potential issues.  Finally, as a last ditch effort, I tried leaving it connected for about 30 hours, because some people in the far reaches of the internet claimed that their Ring suddenly sprung to life after being connected and left alone for one or two days. After a day and a half -  it worked! Suddenly my Ring was functioning, but by then the joy was tainted by the late nights of frustration. Plus, my existing doorbell chime no longer works, but rather than mess with the finicky Ring wiring, I chose to order a Ring Chime and call it a day. Not an experience that I’d recommend to my friends.<br><br>Additionally, I feel the execution  is still a bit low tech. Every time someone from my family leaves through the front door, I get an alert that there’s activity at my door.  Would it really be that difficult to design the unit so that it recognizes whether someone has entered the field of vision from BEHIND the unit as opposed to from the front???  Lastly, it takes a ridiculous amount of time to open the app and begin communicating with someone who has rung the bell.<br><br>The Ring Pro is an attractive piece of hardware, that works really well, when it works, but I’m not sure that I’d buy another one. If the Nest doorbell seems like a solid unit, I may end up purchasing that for my front door and relegating the Ring Pro to my lesser used back door. I really want to like the product but after buying a new transformer, a new voltmeter (!) and a Ring Chime, I’ve sunk $300 into a doorbell that kinda works, and caused me an insane amount of stress.

  I bought this doorbell camera two years again and It was nothing but problems. It did work sometimes, but I would constantly get notified that someone was at my door and when I open the app it would never load the video. If I close the app and reopened it then it would connect but what is the point if I cant see video footage when there is movement. I contacted support a few times and I even eventually swapped my  transformer. I also had a problem with this device connecting to my wifi. I have the unifi suite at home with 3 wireless access points on each floor, the one near my front door is 3 feet away and they only device in my house of around 50 devices that had connectivity problems was the Ring doorbell. A few months back my Ring doorbell just died. No power (Checked the line in with a multimeter and voltage was good). Maybe I had a defective device overall as everyone seems to give them five stars, but in my honest experience it was nothing but trouble.

  I'm very handy and work with computers every day, so I was quite disappointed when the doorbell took over three hours to install - and didn't work!  It would not connect to our wireless access point.  I finally gave up.  But then, the next morning, it had somehow connected to the access point on it's own and was working.<br>Now, we are dealing with intermittent issues - sometimes the indoor legacy doorbell will ring, sometimes it won't (we do have a transformer with the recommend power).  If I access the app to view an event, it can take a VERY long time for the video to load.<br>Liveview, however, comes up within 2-3 seconds.<br>Also, despite having set the Motion Settings to People Only, it is still triggering on small wildlife skittering across our walk, or the trees blowing in the breeze.<br>Despite those issues, I still really like the Ring....I like being able to see our front door and who's there when we are away from the house.

  UPDATE REVIEW: Ring read my review and called us to assist us with our Ring doorbell problem. They troubleshooted our device and found our hardware had malfunctioned and sent us a new replacement within a couple days. They also took a look at our Ring Floodlight cams and gave us setting recommendations to address their connectivity. We made those configurations changes and got all of our Ring devices answering doorbell calls and motion detection. We are glad to have our house live monitoring back and running with our video subscriptions fully catching visitors stepping within the boundaries of our home. It's nice to have peace of mind again knowing we have a reliable system. I encourage you to contact them with technical problems because they will help you get if fixed, good luck!<br><br>3 out of 5 times it works, but when it works, it works great! I'm mainly referring to the answering feature not working 100% of the time. I have not been able to answer a door call because of call freezes even, when Device Health shows strong WIFI signal ups? The Live View works seamlessly but its useless if I cannot answer the door when the delivery person, my kids or a neighbor is at the door! I have frustrated maintained their regular APP updates that they claim fixes the problem? I pay $90/year for one RING doorbell and two floodlights that capture motion successfully, so I am able to see who visited my house surroundings. PLEASE FIX THE ANSWERING FEATURE (and keep upgrades down), and I will gladly upgrade my score from 3 to a full 5, virtual door answering service per RING commercials was the main reason I purchased a RING , thank you!

   We are loving the new Ring doorbell.  It does everything and more I expected it to.  The two areas it falls down is that the audio coming from the person outside often breaks up though more often than not it's possible to understand what they are trying to say.  I have tested this on both 2.4 and 5Ghz wireless, no difference.  The other area is where you set up zones, this would be fantastic if it worked but things outside of the marked zone/s still trigger, not a really big deal just a little irksome.<br><br>Pros<br>fantastic video<br>gives added peace of mind<br>night vision also works very well<br>installation was a breeze<br><br>Cons<br>Audio from outside is frequently choppy<br>""marked zones"" does little to limit false alerts (see video, the road is set not to trigger)

  I like the product a lot, the reason for 3 stars instead of 5 is for 2 main reasons.<br><br>1) The setup process seems a little flawed. When I first connected the doorbell it seemed broken or like I didn’t have enough power running to it. I went out and bought a multimeter to test to make sure I had enough power and it still didn’t turn on like the instructions stated. After doing a little research I read that it had taken up to 24 hours for some people to get theirs to turn on (I’m guessing there is some kind of capacitor inside that needs to fill up). Anyway, sure enough, I was about to send it back but decided to wait a day or so and see if anything happened. About 22 hours later I noticed it was powered up and has been working well ever since (a couple months now).<br><br>2) While the cloud service is reasonably priced, it would be really nice to have an option to store the video locally on your own network instead of having to pay for the cloud service. If you don’t pay for the cloud service, you can only access the live video (what’s currently happening). In other words, if someone steals a package while you’re not watching the live video, you won’t be able to see it and you won’t have access to it for the police.<br><br>Lastly, and this is a minor issue in my opinion, but the “zone” monitoring seems a little flaky. Ultimately you will probably need to tweak the settings a few times until you get the correct amount of notifications in your situation.

  I played around a couple of months before writing this review. My conclusion is, this is not a pro quality product.<br><br>Firstly, it is not consistent and reliable. I have three times faster wi-fi speed than minimum required. Device health checks always yield positive results. I can not open the screen if an alarm is triggered, even when I am at home on the same network (forget when I am roaming); it takes at least 5 seconds at best to see who is at the door and sometimes it never happens. It gets worse at certain hours like in the mornings (inadequate servers, I guess). When a motion is detected, the following few seconds are cropped; you may be losing very important moments. This is not acceptable for a security system.<br><br>Support is weak. Web site contains very basic information; it is more marketing than help. There is no chat option; it is only 800 number. So, I revert to Internet for help. Guess what, most of the problems have been around for over years, and they are still not resolved. I subscribed for the first year, but not thinking of renewing if these problems are resolved.<br><br>Picture quality is mediocre. It is said to be 1080 HD, but the quality is not only the pixels. The lens quality and night vision is poor.<br><br>And lastly, for this price you can buy 3-4 better quality security cameras. For example, I have another equivalent 1080 HD camera, which costed me a quarter of this one, has much sharper image and much faster response time.

  I really like the Ring Doorbell Pro.  I ordered it some time back and finally installed it recently.  The Doorbell Pro is part of an overall package of Ring products I installed for security and safety.  I ended up with 10 total cameras, including the Doorbell Pro, and the Ring Alarm system, as well as many add-ons.<br><br>The Doorbell pro was not difficult to install, but for my installation required I pull new wire up to the installation location since the old wire had issues.  That part required help from one of my DIY knowledgeable sons an patience all around.  Running the wire was not straightforward as we could not just tie the new wire on to the old and pull it through.  Installing the actual doorbell was really quite easy.  I had done the set-up earlier at my workbench and had been testing  for a few weeks to have a good idea of how I wanted to use it.  Overall, other than the wiring, It took 20 minutes to install and set up for the final configuration.  I use 3 Ring Chime's since my old doorbell chimes had already been deinstalled.  I have had no issues with WiFi connectivity, motion sensitivity, audio or the rest.  My home automation interface is platformed on Amazon Alexa and I have had no issues with displaying the doorbell, or other features that are integrated.  Overall I am very happy with the Ring Doorbell Pro.  I do have a wish though, and that is to bring a POE Power option to the Doorbell Pro price point.  I just could not justify $500 for the Doorbell Elite model.  All my other cameras are POE Ring Stickup Wired and the performance is just simply better, as you should expect.

This would be a great addition to the product.  This is a security device that relies on the house power to work.

  I'm obsessed with this company right now. My brother and I purchased the Ring Doorbell 2 for our mother and helped her install it. After playing with it for a while, we both ordered ourselves one.  I love the motion control, as there is a public sidewalk but 10 foot from my door. After selecting the motion zones, the doorbell ignores every movement except for what I've highlighted with the Ring Doorbell Pro.<br><br>I also ordered the chimes for the house, which have hilarious sounds like a turkey gobble available. They work great. My only wish is that the chimes would still sound for motion when I've turned the cell notifications off via the doorbell motion scheduling.<br><br>On a side note, with the recorded video you can see just how your UPS guys handle your packages. All of mine seem to just toss the packages on the ground and run. Nice. After catching one throwing a fragile package onto my step, I jokingly scolded him through the voice controls on the doorbell. Now when he delivers packages he gingerly places them at the door whilst nervously eyeing the doorbell. I love it.

  This is an updated review<br>As noted in the original review, it worked great for about a week, and then we started having issues overnight.  When the glitches started occurring, the unit would report Very Good power, all day long until it got dark at night, and then the unit would suddenly say Very Poor power, and stop working a bit later.  It was fairly repeatable.  Perhaps it was the fact that the nights were getting longer and cooler, but I attributed it to the IR LEDs coming on, when the unit was presumably pulling more current.  So, I swapped out my old doorbell transformer for a new one from Lowes.  The original voltage measured at 11Vac and the new one 18Vac also with a higher current rating.  There have been no issues since.  And we are back to loving it.<br><br>I'd give the unit 5 stars, but do feel that it should report the suboptimal incoming voltage as a problem, not wait till the internal voltage drooped; in other words, the voltage report may not be useful as an instantaneous troubleshooting aid.<br><br>==========orig review==========<br>I installed this and we loved it...  For a week.  It is the hardwired version -- connected to the exiting doorbell wires (a standard transformer-based doorbell) using a small interface board which hides in your indoor doorbell unit -- so I was glad I wouldn't have to mess around with recharging batteries.  I integrated it into my Wink and Amazon Echo smarthome system quickly and conveniently, signed up for the trial cloud recording service, loaded the app on our smartphone, and we were off and running!  Every time we had someone on the porch, we got a notification, and could even interact with them.  This is very handy because sometimes you can't hear the doorbell when you are on the other side of the house.  Also, we are always curious about possible intruders, deliveries, and also little critters that might be sneaking around.  My wife and kid love it as well.<br><br>We grew so accustomed to this, that we were extremely disappointed that after more than a week, the unit has gotten very glitchy.  For the past two days, it is losing connection with the WiFi every evening.  I don't know what the problem is yet, but it isn't hard in principle to fix, but *extremely inconvenient* as it involves unscrewing the outdoor unit from the wall, disconnecting power on the back by removing one wire, waiting a few minutes, and then reconnecting it and reinstalling it to the wall.  When I do this, it quickly reconnects to the WiFi, and even sends me a notification that someone's on the porch (duh, that's me putting you back, doorbell!)  I have done this 3 days in a row hoping that it was a momentary problem, but at this point, it is pretty clear that there's some repeatable issue.<br><br>Why would this thing work so great for more then a week and then get so glitchy?  I don't know yet, but I'm starting the process of contacting customer service at Ring, and trying to figure it out.  We like this thing enough that I'm willing to try more troubleshooting steps.  I compare this experience to the Arlo cameras we have, and I shake my head, because those things are a snap to install, and have been rock solid.  I guess at this point, I would be quite hesitant to buy this again.

  I own 10 or more Ring products including the stickup camera, video dorbell Pro, Floodlight Cam, indoor chimes and solar charger, and I use their cloud storage to save captured video. All are great products and give us great peace of mind when monitoring our home, rental houses and vacation properties. The video door bell pro and flood light cam are our two favorite products. They take good quality video and send us notifications each time a camera or doorbell is triggered. I set up different ringtones for each location so that I know instantly if I need to check my smart phone to see why it triggered. In order for these products to function well, you need to have a strong and fast Wi-Fi signal. Their Wi-Fi extenders help if the property is larger so that the signal can reach all the doors and other camera locations. The fact that the cloud storage allows unlimited devices encourages us to buy and utilize more of their products. Their customer service is excellent. One of my doorbell pros stopped functioning at 13 months, and it came with a 12 month warranty. I called to see if it was cost effective to pay them to try to fix it, since the warranty had expired. They said no problem, and mailed me a replacement at no cost other than returning the broken unit.

  Edit: The Nest Hello doorbell is much better. I got it as a replacement for the Ring Pro. The Nest started working immediately the first time I tried to set it up, the video is higher quality and much more stable and appears instantly when I want to see it, not after a medium delay like with the Ring. The person-sensing works much better than the Ring's motion sensing (which was full of useless false alarms). The familiar face detection function is neat but doesn't work fast enough to reliably announce familiar visitors. It does, however, recognize people for later review on the timeline so that you can filter out people it already recognizes. Google Home integration is neat. Long story short, skip the Ring and get the Nest Hello instead. Read on for my original review of the Ring...<br><br>I really wanted to like this doorbell, but the experience is just thoroughly mediocre. It took 3-4 attempts of doing the exact same setup routine, resetting the doorbell, reconfiguring it, resetting again, etc. to finally get it working, even though each time it would say ""Congratulations, setup is complete"" or something similar... and then fail to actually connect. After it finally worked, the video would cut in and out, the motion sensing doesn't always work, the notifications are often delayed by a minute or two, and to top it all off, my original doorbell no longer sounds (even though I connected the Ring box to the old doorbell following their instructions). The apps aren't great. The Android app has a confusing setup process (""pull down to refresh wifi lists"" doesn't work unless you touch a special part of the screen, the rename device screen has no OK/save button), the website app just plain won't load my activity half the time, the desktop apps don't start with the system or lurk in the background, etc. So many annoying, minor flaws lead to a very unsatisfying experience for what is essentially a glorified webcam.<br><br>That said, the recordings do seem to work and are sent to the cloud, the Live View usually (but not always) works in a second or two, the image quality is great, night vision works, and it delivers on the basic promise of a video doorbell. I just wish the implementation were more polished and less buggy throughout.

I am not tech-savvy and had issues getting it connected to our wi-fi.  Once connected I started getting my first notifications (mostly for me walking around on the porch).  Overnight I got a bunch of notifications which I didn't see until morning because I have my phone set to 'do not disturb' mode overnight.  Retrieving the videos was easy.  I didn't know we had so many cats roaming our porch.  Deleting the video is easy too.  We plan to continue the cloud storage once the 30 day trial membership is over.  It's inexpensive, and I don't see what good it is to have videos if you can't save and retrieve them later.  The only issue is that our wifi internet connection isn't the best so sometimes it affects the doorbell video.  Bummer, but that's the price of living in the boonies.<br><br>UPDATE May 2019:  We have had this connected for over a month now.  I reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because of a few issues as follows.<br>1. The video doesn't always catch cars and people going by, even though I have the zone set up to view the walks and roadway.  It picks up the morning school buses and odd cars going by at night, but it doesn't pick up the afternoon school bus, the people driving by on golf carts or the joggers during the daytime.  Not even once did it video them, and only rarely did it record the mailman driving up.  But it almost always picks up the UPS truck.<br>2. The video bell records every cat that walks across our front porch at night, but when the mailman walks up to our porch, it usually doesn't begin recording until after he presses the doorbell....and even then it's often recording him as he walks away.  But it records just fine when I take the dog out for a walk and then return later.  So far I haven't used this to communicate with people who ring the bell.  I tried once with the mailman but by the time I signed into my phone and brought up the live feed, the person was already halfway back to his vehicle.<br>3. When I'm away from home, only a couple times have I ever received a notification that someone is at my door, even though when I return home and check I can see that the video had been triggered while I was gone.<br>4.  Retrieving the live feed after getting a notification that someone is in the front yard is almost useless.  It takes about 15 seconds for me to retrieve my phone, log in and then bring up the Ring app.  By then too much time has gone by so that whatever was in the video zone is long gone.  I've determined that, unless I'm actively using my phone and the Ring app is already open, it is better to just ignore it, let the video record the event and then retrieve it in a minute or so.<br>5.  Something I didn't expect is that thunder and lightning activates the video.  At first I thought maybe the wind blowing the trees caused it but it wasn't really windy.  But often when the lightning struck, I got a 'motion detected' warning.  It was a little annoying, but the system has a function that will allow you to put it in snooze mode for as long as you want so that you won't have to hear the alerts.  They'll still record so you can retrieve them later, but the alerts won't disturb you.<br>On the PRO side, the audio on this thing is amazing.  I retrieved one video of a car late at night that stopped in front of a house kitty-corner from us.  Two men got out and were talking to each other, and I could understand most of what they said.  And birds?  Holy cow, I can hear so many birds even at 2 am.  Can't sleep?  Just open the live feed and listen to the crickets, frogs and birds for a while. Also the video quality is top-notch.  Very clear.<br>Overall, so far I'm satisfied with this purchase.  It bugs me that some movement in the zone is not caught by the doorbell, but I like the quality and ease of playback when something records.  For those times when I've been home and I know someone has been on my front walk or porch, the doorbell has always alerted me and recorded it, even if it was a bit late on rare occasions.  I purchased the $30 per year plan so I can keep and access my videos any time, and I think it's well worth it.

  Edit:  Ring cares about its customers.<br><br>My Ring Doorbell Pro stopped working after 21 months, and after my initial Amazon review and probably their review of the device logs, they must have determined that the problem was something that slipped by QC.  They replaced the device, requiring only that I return the original defective unit for examination.  I was glad to see they've kept the mounting specs the same, so I didn't have to tear everything apart just to put the new one in.  I would like to see Ring extend the warranty to two or three years, even though it is apparent they intend to protect their customers and reputation past the current one year warranty period.<br><br>During the time I had the original, the app would very often fail to connect to Ring to respond to alerts.  That seems not to be such a problem so far with the replacement.  Some updates to the app may have smoothed its connection problems.  I think the device is at a good price point for the features you get, and I'd recommend their doorbell and stickup cams to anyone. - - not a paid advertisement, and actually a pretty skeptical curmudgeon...

5.0 out of 5 stars,AWESOME DOORBELL AND SIMPLE TO INSTALL!,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2017","<span>
  This is a great little door bell, I love it!  The installation was very simple.  The instructions actually make it sound more difficult than it really is.  Download the ring app from the app store first.  Youtube has a video you can watch with instructions on how to install it, which again, makes it so simple to understand.  I didn't want to take a chance of being electrocuted even though it's low voltage wires so I turned the power off on my house.  Once that's done....The unit comes neatly packed in the box with several different colored face plates, so you can chose one that matches your house (I used the cream colored one since it's the exterior color of our home, it blends in better than silver) The box contains all the connectors needed and came ready to go, so all that was really needed was to remove the lid off the inside bell of the door bell, unscrew the existing wires, plug them in and stick the ring unit onto the side of our existing doorbell inside the home. Even the double sided tape came pre-attached to the unit so all you have to do is remove the paper and stick it up.<br>Outside, the install for the doorbell/camera  was just as easy as the inside. My doorbell was installed onto siding, so I didn't have to drill through stucco or anything (but if you have stucco, it comes with a template, and the drill bit to drill through stucco).  For me, I just pulled the doorbell out of the siding (mine was not screwed in, it was just fitted into the hole in the wall where the wiring was) I removed the wiring from the existing doorbell, plugged the wiring into the ""ring"" unit, screwed it into the siding and that's pretty much it for the install.  It's really THAT simple.  After that, just push the button on the side of the unit to pair it, hook it up to your wifi and set it up with ""zones"", and you're good to go.<br>The motion detection is very sensitive.  Mine went off continually with every passing car, straggling cat passing by through our yard and blowing trees from the wind we've been having.  I kept it turned up the first couple days to see how it would be and just be warned, you will have a LOT of videos to go through that are meaningless.  You can turn the sensitivity down on the motion detector to just detect people, which I do, during the day.  At night however, I want it turned on for any movement just to be safe.  All in all, I really like my new doorbell! I'm a female and if I can set it up and install it easily, anyone can! I'm going to purchase the ring camera next to set up in our back yard next.  I highly recommend this, SUPER SIMPLE TO INSTALL! :)

  The ring pro lived up to the hype.  The video quality is great and the customizable motion detection zones are a great addition.  Also the fact that it runs on your existing door bell power means no battery to replace and it is always on.<br><br>The bad,  the wifi chip sucks.  I had to add a second wifi access point in my home to get the door bell to work.  Standing next to the door bell I had full signal on my phone and confirmed with a tablet and my laptop. The ring pro just could not pull more than a single bar of signal from my existing wifi router less than 40 feet away.  The router is upstairs and there are a few walls in between, but the fact that every other device I tried could get a solid signal in the same location points to a poor quality wifi chip or lack of antennae in the ring unit.  Thankfully I had an extra wifi router I was able to install close to the door and get it working.  Ring tech supports answer was to purchase one of their stand alone wall wart repeaters.  That is a great idea for those who do not have an extra router or repeater sitting around, but it feels like they purposely attenuated the signal strength of the ring pro unit to encourage you to buy additional hardware.<br><br>I would have rated this product a 10 if I did not have wifi signal strength issues in a small home with the wifi router less than 40 feet away.

  I've had the Ring system in my home now for roughly a year and a half. I have a few Floodlight Cams and had this doorbell as well. The positive is the customer support. It's a good thing too because I needed it. Initially the doorbell worked well, although the video was always delayed. Someone would ring the doorbell and it would take between 15-20 seconds for the app to notify and then another 20 or so seconds to pull the video up. It would capture in the cloud but that's purpose defeating in my opinion. I decided to upgrade to a mesh wireless system after customer support told me my wifi signal wasn't strong enough for the second flood light cam I put up. As an FYI the rccommeded distance is 15 to 25 feet. Again not the best set of circumstances for something you know is going on the outside of the house. None the less, with the mesh in place and a node placed within the distance it still wouldn't stay connected. The only thing that did allow it to connect was the ring chime pro. So, be prepared to purchase that if you meet the same limitations I did. I say ll of that to say that the doorbell worked flawlessly for about 8-9 months. Then it just died. No power battery had a charge, voltage was good, it just died. The ring customer support was great and replaced it after attempting some trouble shooting. Second unit came and connected without issue signal showed strong etc. Fast forward 3 weeks can't get connected or stay connected.About four hard resets and complete disconnects I replaced it with a Nest Hello. Time will tell if it holds up any better but so far it's been dead on, and hasn't experienced any of the lag. I did give it a fair shot but I'm not going to continue to invest in products that have a design flaw like not having a strong enough antenna to pick up a wifi signal within the specified parameters. It's dissappointing to because the Flood Cams are the only real product in their category so they are staying for now.

  I purchased a ring flood cam and a chime when Ring first came out, the phone support was outstanding! Now that Amazon has bought out ring I purchased a door bell pro for my rental. I called to get some help installing first I was put on hold for 7 minutes, second the tech could not get his email to work so he could send me the code for permission to see the view through my camera, he put me on hold then hung up on me! Third, I called back got a woman that sounded like she was in a sweat shop, the background noise was terrible, she had no idea what she was talking about, my question was about motion area picking up passing cars on my street and she kept saying my doorbell was 3'9"" off the ground and it need to be 4' feet that's why heads were not visible on the camera??? That was not my issue, I finally got so frustrated with her and the people yelling in the background I just said good bye.  I will try to figure it out myself. It is sad that tech support went from excellent to second rate after the sale of Ring Co.

  Overall I like the Ring Pro.  My first suggestion is to watch the price as it fluctuates, and try to price the bundle.  It was recently $199 alone and $209 with a 3rd generation dot.  I took the $209 bundle.<br><br>I think it is well made and the box includes basically all you need to install it.  The doorbell includes 4 faceplates (off white, black, silver and bronze) as well as a mounting plate for uneven surfaces and a wedge and angled mount if you need to direct the camera in a specific direction.  The box also includes a small screwdriver tool, all needed mounting hardware (screws, anchors, etc.) and a set of wires for the power pack should you not be able to use the primary, included ""spade"" type wires.  The kit also includes a power pack (this is small just an inch or so L x W.<br><br>I mounted my ring where my old mechanical doorbell was, so it is to the left of my door.<br><br>So my likes:<br>* It is easy to install.<br>* Joining your WiFi network is a typical, simple process.<br>* The application works well once launched.<br>* The video on a phone or PC is clear.<br>* Compatibility with Echo so Alexa can announce that someone is at your door.<br>* Can be used with your Fire TV, but logistically unless you happen to be on the Fire input this is  a bust.  I tend to be on FIOS, so if the Ring goes off, I would need to change my Input on my remote, then get the Fire remote and tell Alexa to show me the door.  Yes it works, but more for monitoring than to answer the door.<br>* Very convenient to use, helpful when you are not home (or home), and this by itself outweighs all the cons.  But there are some cons:<br><br>Now, the bad:<br>* Before I got very far, I needed to use the ""You probably won't need these"" wires on the power pack.  The default wires have spades which screw down on your mechanical doorbell wires.  My mechanical unit is old and has clips not screws.  To Ring's credit, they do include the wires.<br>* During setup, the Ring had trouble joining my WiFi twice, inexplicably.  Although I have a good router signal, and my Ring is not that far from it, joining, while simple, took 2-3 times.<br>* Ring needs to let you know up front that if you have an old transformer, or an underpowered one, you may need to upgrade.  Mine is from the Year One and when I first connected it, the Device health screen on the Ring read ""Very Poor"" voltage on and off the first day.  Since then it has read ""very Good"".<br>* How on Earth can you NOT use an Echo or Echo Dot to ask ""Answer The Front Door?""  How is that not a basic compatibility feature?<br>* The doorbell ring has ONE option? I mean what the heck.  You can have a bunch of rings on the phone app, a bunch on the Echo, but the doorbell itself makes one sound outside, an annoying one at that.<br>* There is a little lag between when someone rings the bell and it chimes inside (Echo).  Not long, maybe a couple of seconds.<br>* Same type of lag launching the phone app, so basically you have to leave someone standing there, door unanswered for a few seconds while you launch the app, it renders video, etc.<br><br>Overall, I like it and it serves its purpose.<br><br>Aside from that it works well.  You do have to find your own sweet spot for motion sensitivity and motion fields.  Even after I adjusted my field to omit any trace of the street, so I had just my porch and lawn, the Ring would go off falsely, particularly at night when a car's headlights might light the edge of my lawn.  I ended up using the lowest setting (People Only) and it is fine.

  So let’s be honest. You see all the advertisements and get all excited. Oh wow so much easier.<br><br>So 1/2 the time the internal door bell in your house won’t activate.

Unless you do finally get that to stop then you find people are able to stand outside your door and your still not getting notified.<br><br>Next up support. Well sometimes they are great. Other times you are like how the heck do I even get support. The neighbors aspect is where you will struggle with support.

  Was expecting much more.  Setup was fairly easy, worked great for about 2 days.  Now, 1/2 time won't connect.  Lets me know there is motion but I stare at a black screen and spinning circle because it wont connect.  Go back to watch, but 1/2 the videos are just black screens.  Also, when it does work, it takes so long to connect you are usually looking at the person's back as they are walking off.  Spent more for the pro because I thought it had a faster response time.<br><br>More frustrating to get woken up at 2am by the motion sensor only to see a black screen and spinning blue circle and not knowing what is there.<br><br>Update 6 months later: The function of the doorbell has actually gotten worse. To the point that even if you can see who is at your door, the image freezes consistently each time so if someone was stealing stuff from porch the video is worthless and irretrievable.  This product is a big waste of money.<br><br>Update 18 months later:  $250 doorbell quits working.  Enough said.

  Before purchasing the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, I did my research.  I wanted to see what others were saying about it, and what problems they were having, if any.  I read all reviews with less than 3 stars and watched videos on You Tube of people making an installation.  It soon became apparent to me that the critical part of the installation and operation of the Pro was the transformer.  It calls for a 16V transformer with a VA of at least 30, but that part is a bit fuzzy.  Most existing transformers in our homes are 16V, but have much less than a 30VA.  I believe the VA's are the most critical.  Anyway, I purchase a new 24V 40Va transformer from Amazon and replaced my existing transformer.  I believe a 40VA transformer is the key.  After that is just a matter of hooking up the Pro Power Kit (super easy), and then removing the existing doorbell and installing the Ring Pro.  It comes with several different backing plates and face plates so you can easily adjust the angle of the camera and the color of the face plate.  Connecting to my wifi was simple as I used the ""code"" with my cell phone, followed the simple instructions, and I was in.  At first every time a bird flew by, or a tree branch moved, or a car drove by, it would alert me of motion at the front door.  Quick witted as I am, I looked at the instructions and discover I could reduce the sensitivity which solved the problem.  It is a neat device.  I was able to answer my doorbell from the grocery store and the guy didn't even know we were not home.  Do your research, look over the project before beginning, and then have fun making the installation.  Easy peasy.

  Going from an old generation video doorbell to Ring Pro, I was excited with all the features.  Unfortunately it took me 3 days to get it functional.  My existing transformer running my old mechanical indoor chime (ding dong) was only about 10 volts, so I gave it a try, and Ring Pro would not connect to my wifi.  No surprise.  Went and bought a new transformer, a 3 way unit, gives choice of 10 volt, 16 volt, 24 volt.  Thought I was good.  Wired the 16 volt to the Ring Pro, still no connection to wifi, although it momentarily gave me a taste, connected for 10 minutes, unconnected, failed to reconnect.  Lots of resets, turning off power, testing output of transformer.  Despite reading the install manual, and lots of youtube videos, I noted the 16 volt which I thought was satisfied.  Was running a new Hampton Bay digital chime with the Ring Pro, which added a variable cause for non-function too.  Finally caught on that besides the 16 volt minimum, the Ring Pro needs a minimum of 30 volt-amps of power.  So my new transformer puts out 16 or 24 volts, but at only 20 volt-amps, plenty for most uses.  I bought another transformer, a 16 volt, 40 volt-amp unit, and Ring Pro came to life, connected to my phone via wifi for setup, then to my home wifi network, all was working.  Even during my 45 minutes phone conversation with Ring tech support, there was never a comment about the volt-amps required, only the 16 volt requirement.  For now, my Ring Pro has been working for several days, no wifi loss.

If not there it should be close to it, mounted on a metal plate about the size of a light switch cover.<br><br>They supply a ""Power Pro"" gadget to wire into your mechanical doorbell. Your doorbell is on a simple loop circuit and pressing your doorbell button completes that loop so it can work.<br><br>When you install the camera, it obviously needs a constant supply of power which means it has to complete the loop (which would activate your mechanical doorbell.)

I did the setup on my iPhone, it hooks up no problem. Then a couple hours later it loses connectivity with the wi-fi. I try to get it to re-connect, no luck. It just says it cannot connect to Ring-xxxxx. I call support and he has me go through a long list of things to try. He even asked if I had a different device to use for the setup as iPhone's have more issues with it. I then try it with my husband Android phone. Still the same issue.

I try to setup the doorbell again. No luck, same message as before.

  Ring has a fine and high quality product in the Doorbell Pro.  However, you need a stable internet connection along with a very good home Wi-Fi network that's ideally 5GHz. I am not a fan of the proprietary Ring video feed which gets sent to the their cloud. I understand that it's their revenue model but 3 bucks a month is too much. It all adds up with monthly subscriptions for Nest, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime etc.<br><br>I am also not thrilled about the fact that the video stream is encrypted and can't be sent to my Blue Iris video surveillance system. There is even a workaround for Nest video cameras but not yet with Ring.<br><br>So if you're a surveillance freak with many cameras and you want all your feeds in the same place, this product isn't for you because it supports neither ONVIF nor RTSP. However, for everyone else, this is a fine product though a bit expensive. But you get a lot for it including US-based tech support which is very responsive. That is always great to see.

You will likely end up paying a monthly fee to access videos only (otherwise only get live view, which doesn't help if something bad happens), but that's a fee you'll gladly pay once you get comfortable with your Ring.<br><br>If your install is anything less than flawless, be aware the Ring Pro requires a solid 14V, we ended up running new wiring from our doorbell chime to the transformer.  However, none of our friends have had any problems getting theirs installed. The 24/7 free support has been fantastic, should you ever have a question.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid this Ring Doorbell,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020","<span>
  I have had trouble with this Ring Doorbell Pro from the beginning. The doorbell itself works, but no video connection. It will stay online for every bit of an hour then it will go offline and never connect back to wifi. I have to factory reset the device and set it up from scratch. This will work about 1 in 3 times. Most of the time it will say unable to connect to Ring network or it won't go into setup mode at all. If I shutoff power to the bell for awhile it tends to finally setup correctly, but then it just loses connection again, soon after.<br><br>I thought there was maybe an issue with my router, but my other 2 Ring Doorbells work just fine. So that can't be it. Everything I have found on the internet comes back to me needing to call Ring Support, do the same trouble shooting with them, that I have already done a dozen times, then after about an hour on the phone, they will tell you it is a defective device. There seems to be a common theme with the Ring Doorbell Pro.<br><br>Save yourself the headaches and purchase a different device.

  I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with the results. The unit is well made and comes in quality packaging and Ring has attempted to make the installation easy by including tools and mounting components in the box. The only thing missing is a mount to angle the camera or a lens adjustment facility so that the field of view can be optimized.<br>Installation is straight forward if you have a regular door bell installation. Set up was not helped by the install instructions telling me to press the orange button which is not present on the Pro model. You have to press the button on the side of the Pro unit to get it into setup mode. Until you get the device connected to your wi-fi all you have is a bell button. This is where it gets tricky because the app setup asks for your location.  You have to get this step correct because until the app has located the address it will not progress onto the wi-fi setup. Ring could definitely improve this part of the setup in the app because it caused me a few minutes of frustration trying to work out how to get the device into wi-fi set up.<br>Once you get the doorbell connected to your wifi the rest of the process is pretty straight forward. The video recording at $30 per year is reasonable and hopefully this revenue keeps this great little company in business for the long term.<br>Before you embark on installing the doorbell it is a good idea to test the wi-fi signal that you will connect to at the doorbell location. Ring says you need a minimum of 1mb download and upload speed for the video doorbell to function satisfactorily. If your doorbell location has a weak or no signal location you might need to look at installing a wi-fi signal booster, a second access point closer to the doorbell or possibly moving your router closer to the doorbell location.

  The instructions do not tell you it requires at least 16v - 30A my doorbell was 16v 10a and would not work.  I only found this after reading their troubleshooting guide.  Two transformers later (first 10a second 40a) and I realize the door bell is doa.  Power was off during install, and measured power at wires to verify voltage.  For such an expensive doorbell you would think it would work out of the box. I will update once product is working.

  Ring did a fantastic job with their doorbell, the app software, and the install process.  I bought the Ring Pro as I wanted a wired doorbell and I like the sleek look of the Pro.  The total install took 20 minutes.  If you are considering purchasing a Ring doorbell, do yourself a favor and check a few things beforehand:  check your transformer if you are going with a wired unit to verify that it is the proper voltage and size, unscrew your current push button and ensure your doorbell wire is long enough and in decent condition, and lastly make sure your internet connection can support the Ring's video streaming.  If all are good, you will have an easy installation.<br><br>In a nutshell, the cover is pulled off the existing doorbell chime and the ""power module"" is attached to the two terminals for the door where you are installing the Ring.  I don't know exactly what this little box does, but presume it is a filter and regulator.  The Ring is then mounted and the two wires attached.  That is it for the physical work..  The app is downloaded and installed, set up an account, scan the Q code, and you are live!<br><br>I really like the three motion settings.  You can adjust the sensitivity to only capture large objects (hopefully people), the motion area can easily be set up (even in multiple zones), and the motion notifications can be scheduled to turn off alerts on specified days and time periods.<br><br>What I dislike is the triggering of the motion detector by car headlights.  Even at the lowest sensitivity and with a motion zone cutting out half my front yard, cars driving by or turning will trigger an alert.  I read other reviews with this same problem, so Ring needs to get this resolved.  I have used the motion scheduler to eliminate alerts while we sleep which works, but it also defeats the purpose.  Keep in mind that even if the alerts are suppressed, any event is still recorded which is a good thing.  Some are complaining about this, but if something happens it is better to have too much video rather than none...<br><br>On that note, a fantastic improvement to the app would be the addition of a quick review button where the events would be sequentially played backward at an adjustable fast speed (2x, 3x, 4x).  This would make finding a relative event easy and quick.  The addition of a watermark of the date and time in the player would also be a good enhancement.<br><br>The video quality is very good.  The daytime quality is very clear and smooth.  The night mode is adequate for any action close to the doorbell.  In this application, I do like the wide angle lens as it gives such a wide view of my entire front yard with my flat fronted ranch house.  There is distortion with the lens, but I think it is better to have a larger field of vision with the Ring doorbell.  The fact that there is minimal distortion in the middle of the field makes it acceptable as this covers your entryway and people are easily identifiable.<br><br>Why haven't you bought one yet?

  Though I had heard of the Ring Doorbell prior to my purchase – I had no real sense of just how fundamentally this doorbell could change my sense of security and awareness.  I now have the ability to check in on my house at any time, from anywhere, using any of the numerous phones, tablets, or computers that I have available.<br><br>The free App for Android, Apple, and PC can be configured to alert as someone approaches the doorbell, and/or when the doorbell’s button is pressed.  As long as you have access to the internet you can interact with the doorbells functions to see and communicate through the doorbell.<br><br>The recordings made by the doorbell are brilliant both day and night.  The doorbell can “see” even in total darkness because it is equipped with infra-red illuminators; infra-red recordings are essentially “black and white”, but are contain very high-fidelity images.<br><br>Installation took more effort than simply swapping out the old doorbell for the new one, but is well within the capabilities of the modest “handy person”.  Ring provides the screw driver, drill bit, and inserts needed to cover all installation-surface challenges, and the instructions are among the best I’ve ever used.<br><br>Our house has many places where the doorbell cannot be heard, and I am planning to add several of the modular “bells” that are available – but in reality they aren’t needed if one or two of your phones, tablets or PC’s have the app installed – they are really all that is needed if kept in proximity so that you can hear them or feel the buzz when muted.  You don’t have to be anywhere near the house to hear this doorbell.<br><br>A strong wireless signal is a must for the doorbell, and Ring makes a repeater that requires little more than plugging into a 110 volt socket.<br><br>The subscription price for a single doorbell is modest, but ongoing, and being somewhat technical I would like to have the option to opt-out of the subscription model, however there is considerable value and functionality that Ring provides and it is fully maintained for you by Ring.<br><br>All in all I would have to say that I am extremely pleased with the Ring Doorbell Pro, and with the service that Ring is providing.  I highly recommend this product.

  Best device I have ever purchased. Every home should get one. After installation I was amazed how fast I caught someone in my driveway at 2am looking in my car window. I had no idea what he was up to but I know he went out of his way to be where he was. I f every home in the neighborhood got one of these crime would be non existent. I now ordered 2 spot cams with solar panels and another ring doorbell pro for my back door to watch the rear of house. Take the time to adjust the motion zones eliminating false alerts on your cell phone. Never gives a false alert and video is amazing when it triggers. This system is much more superior to a wired security camera setup as it only records and event. My old system is now useless as unless you suspect a problem you will never know it. Also it is a pain to shuffle thru camera footage to check and event. This thing only gives you what you want. The built in neighborhood watch is amazing. You have to see the videos that people share with neighborhood and local police department. Don’t second guess yourself and purchase at least the doorbell pro and I guarantee you will be buying many more to get your whole property.

  I wish I did more research before buying. I bought the ring doohrbell because our mailbox was recently vandalized in the middle of the night. The ring pro works great in the day but doesn't pickup people at night until they are about 3 feet from the camera, even at the highest sensitivity, which still picks up every car that runs by. I can stand directly in front of the camera on the porch steps with no motion detected until I'm right up to the door.<br><br>Pressing the doorbell no longer rings our mechanical doorbell which is still the main purpose of a doorbell. After research it seems the ring pro runs hot and disables the ringing of the actual doorbell in order to keep itself cooler. It's currently 65 degrees outside and cloudy and no mechanical doorbell.<br><br>Finally I'm disappointed that I can't set separate motion sensitivities and alerts for individual zones. For example I'd like to be able to record and alert zone 1 while just recording motion in zone 2 without an alert.<br><br>I was initially excited about this doorbell and had planned to slowly add the spot and flood light cameras for all 4 sides of the house but in it's present state I can't justify spending that kind of money for security cameras that are only truly effective during daylight.

  Love it! This product is much better in real life than even the reviews claim. The amount of settings that are on the app allow for much specification to your own needs. The fact that I was able to connect it to my original wired doorbell chime made me even happier, and I did not need to buy any additional products/adapters to do so (it all comes in the package). There is also a social media network within the ring app, that allows you to connect &amp; share important info/cam videos with your neighbors based on the distance parameters you choose. Overall, the app is incredibly user-friendly. The directions you receive in the box, and online, are very easy to follow, even for a beginner like me who has never worked with electrical items like this before. The camera has a very wide angle lens, so you will get a lot of area covered wherever you put the camera. I am already planning on purchasing additional RING products in the near future &amp; Will integrate them as one overall security system around my house.

  I give this system five stars because of the technical support. The hardware is good, well designed and built, but it’s installed into ‘questionable places’ (using your current doorbell system for power). After installation (guided by a couple of brief questions to tech support), the doorbell connected easily to our network and worked well with the app … but the inside ringer no longer worked.<br><br>After discussing of our 40+ year-old doorbell system transformer having low voltage with tech support, and discovering we have two ringers (exacerbating the low voltage problem), the tech volunteered to send a Ring Chime.

Ring says they can send a local installer for $50 if the above bothers you. And if you want to stay away from ‘old and cranky’ doorbell systems, Ring makes two other models that are battery operated. We’re going to install one on our side door where there is no doorbell.

  I've had the Doorbell Pro installed for a few weeks and the best I could say is that it does an ""adequate"" job. The video is reasonable enough in the daylight and at night.

  Update on Original 4 out of 5 stars to a straight 5 star rating and here is why:<br>  My original post is located below the original post line, this review is coming 1 year and 1 month after the original post.<br>My wife and I recently noticed that the ring app would freeze up when trying to use the microphone. After self troubleshooting and research online I finally made the dreaded call to customer technical support which is something that everyone dreads. Dialing the support number I braced myself for the never ending conversation with someone that is hard to understand and even harder to get to understand the issue so Imagine my surprise when the person I was directed to was not that at all. I am not sure if I should share his name so I will just call him Mr. K., Mr. K. slowly walked through the issue with me and indulged my interruptions of what I believed the issue could be and what my trouble shooting methodology was (I'm an IT by trade so I kinda nuked it, &lt;--- Military people will get the reference lol). I gave him temporary access to my ring device as we slowly walked through the troubleshooting process one inch at a time. I will spare you the painful details (which to be honest I think he went as far as he did troubleshooting just to indulge me and my compulsion to over analyze everything to the smallest degree) before dropping the big bomb, my ring unit would have to be replaced and it was out of warranty. Of course my first thought was, of course it is and now I have to pay another $200+ dollars because this is what all these companies do, sell you something that is going to fail right after the warranty expires! So containing all my rage and indignation I asked how much it will cost hoping he would have a less costlier solution. His reply was simple, We appreciate our customers and would like to show our appreciation to you for being so patient during the T/S'ing process as well as being a loyal customer that we are going to replace your device at no cost to you. Immediately I found myself deflated and embarrassed for my unexpressed anger, but still still that feeling of suspicion hung over me so I politely asked if this would be a refurbished or new replacement, his answer was honest and straight forward. It depends on what is in stock. Sometimes refurbs are sent after going through the re certification process if they are in stock, and if not, then they will send out a new one. They do not have a set policy of replacing with either or as a priority. Well now I really felt like a jerk because I have finally come across that rare gem in customer service, the person that is there to actually help, takes pride in the company they work for and the products they sell. This interaction in itself (not the free replacement) was what made this company and product 5 out of 5 stars for me, even with the original issues still in play. I can be happy with this product even without the things I noted knowing that when I need help with the product, I can get it, and the person on the other side of the phone is patient, helpful, knowledgeable and willing to help. So to summarize, Ring is in my experience, one of the few companies willing to continue to provide great customer service by not farming it out to cheaper alternatives and having what in my case was a very knowledgeable and patient CS rep as well as a superior product (I am referring to the ring door bell since it is the only product that I have been able to purchase). Did it have an issue?... yes...  was it a non functioning product?... No ... Most importantly, was I able to get the issue rectified at no cost... absolutely... Thank you Mr. K. and thank you ring for your exemplary Customer Service.<br><br>________________________________________Original Post_____________________________________________________________<br>I just received my Ring video doorbell pro and the installation was very simple and straight forward. The first thing I noticed was that the it took a little while after the installation was complete for the bell to start working. I am not sure if that is normal but if you do the install and the door bell does not work immediately you may want to wait 10 or 15 minutes before trouble shooting. I set up the motion senser zone and it worked as advertised, so far no false triggers but it has only been installed a few hours. The video is clean and very clear, the voice function works well unlike other users, the lag from sensor being triggered to app notification was about a second or two. The live view works and is a very convenient function. The IOS app works well and was very simple to use, the windows 10 app... no so much. The reason it gets a 4 star and not 5 is because of the following.<br><br>1. Windows 10 app is buggy, when I try to set up the detection zone distance it gives me the following error ""Arg_InvalidCastException""<br>2. Only six partners and none of them are smart home technologies I use. (this is of course my personal pet peeve and they may expand the partner list in the future)<br>3. The lens they use gives the live view and video a fish eye lens effect. I don't understand why they did not use a field flattener to get rid of the distortion.<br>4. Live View has a time limit. This is very confusing to me, I am not sure why I can not open the live view viewer and just let it stream the video to my computer when I am sitting in my office. One of the reasons I got this particular model was because of the live view, I thought I would be able to live stream to my computer when I am sitting in my home office so that I can watch for packages being delivered. USPS has a habit of dropping off packages and leaving without ringing the door bell, this has led to many packages being stolen from peoples porches and doorways.<br><br>Lastly, if you are like me and have multiple smart home products that you would like to tie in to your ring video doorbell (I have hue lights and wanted to set it up so that my porch light would come on when the motion sensor on the ring video doorbell sensed motion, this can only be done through IFTTT, needless to say, that is not a good solution since it takes 10 to 15 minutes before IFTTT polls for new action requests which means that if someone walks up to the door my light will probably not go on till they have either entered my home or left.) you will need to have wink products so if you are using Wi-Fi, ZigBee, or Z-Wave you are out of luck. If it is compatible with a hub such as smart things, wink, insteon or any of the others is a mystery to me and I have not been able to find anything online. All and all it seems to work well, with a few tweaks I think this thing can easily be a 5 out of 5. I will post a follow up after it has been installed for a while.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great now that they updated echo,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2018","<span>
  When I initially got this I was disappointed. I got a bundle deal with the ring doorbell pro and an echo spot. Major flaw at the time was that the echo devices in my house did not have the capability to announce a doorbell ring or motion. When you market them together, you expect a certain level of compatibility. The ring skill only allowed you to view the camera on demand. So you needed another device such as a smartphone to make a chime sound through the ring app. This wasn't good enough considering sometimes other people are home while i'm out - one time nobody knew a food delivery came while I was running errands. With the latest update to Alexa this is different. Now you can turn on all of the echo devices in your home to announce a doorbell ring or a motion. Wonderful!<br>Installation was easy (the second time). The first time I was having so much trouble so I contacted support. They were wonderful and helped me debug. They determined my first one was faulty and so I got a replacement through amazon at no cost. That second one I had setup completely in like 10 minutes. The only snag I have is that the existing mechanical doorbell chime doesn't ring like it should. It's rather old and I can see that it moves when the doorbell rings - just not enough to actually make a noise. I take no stars for this because the chime is mostly to blame here.<br>I recommend a strong wifi throughout your house if you start using smart home stuff like this. I have a mesh wifi system from netgear and it's fantastic.<br>I love being able to check on things when i'm not home. I know when packages show up and when people come to my door and when people leave. It gives me great piece of mind. I expect to start adding more ring products soon now that they fixed the compatibility with echo a bit better.

  Easy to install assuming you have a reasonably modern existing door bell set up.  You do need to add a power pack to the existing chime in the house, I would guess most houses built in the last 20-30 years will have the right set up, older not so sure but likely do have what you need, the old chime systems have been around a long time.  Once that is done you remove the existing door bell button and replace with the Ring unit.  Then set up the software on your phone and if needed/wanted add a remote chime.  All of this went very well for me, done in well under an hour start to finish.  In my particular case I have a large overhang above the front door, this seems to keep the camera in night mode but I still get a good picture of what is going on, just usually in B&amp;W rather than full color.  The  software with the Pro allows you to tune the area of motion detection which works pretty well for me although I am still playing with it a bit.  Before you order, you may want to go outside with your smartphone and be sure you are getting a reasonably good signal in the area of the existing doorbell button just to be sure.

  I bought a Ring Video Doorbell Pro this summer and finally got around to installing it last night. I came home, had dinner, drank a beer and then grabbed my tools and installed the doorbell. Installation was dead easy. I looked at my Amazon order history because I had purchased my doorbell and transformer from Amazon and found that the transformer I had purchased had the capacity to power the Ring doorbell as well as my mechanical chimes.  I turned off the circuit breaker that feeds the doorbell transformer (among other things), installed the little widget that clips on to your existing doorbell chimes, figured out how to best use the included shims to properly angle the Ring do (they worked perfectly, compensating for the slant of the boards on my siding and allowing me to angle the doorbell out to get a better view of my front porch), attached the doorbell wires to the Ring doorbell, attached the doorbell to the wall and turned the breaker back on. I installed the Ring app on my phone and tablet, scanned the QR code on the Ring and in a few minutes the system was up and running. Total installation time was about an hour, and this was because I needed to find the breaker that controlled the doorbell transformer (which wasn't on the circuit I thought it was) and because I needed to charge a drill battery so I could mount the bracket to the wall.<br>The Ring app says that I have a weak WiFi signal. I put a base station by the doorbell and it still complained about having a week WiFi signal, so I told the app to ignore my weak Wifi signal and go ahead with the installation and everything worked.<br>The image quality from the camera is excellent, especially since it's behind a fish-eye lens. The night vision feature is impressive. My porch isn't visible from the street so light from the streetlights doesn't reach it and it gets quite dark. With my porch lights off I was still able to see what was happening on my porch. Now I want to purchase one of these for the door that goes out to my deck.

  The Ring Video Doorbell pro is fantastic.  We love it.  Installation was super easy.  I did purchase the 45 degree bracket as otherwise I would not have been able to get the entire walkway up to the house.  Installation took maybe 15 minutes.  Download the app, and finish the install.  Works great.  I have had no problems with it.  Bottom line, it can alert you when someone walks up by the front door.  Then will alert you when someone pushes the doorbell.  I was at Lowes after a contractor said he would be at my house at 10.  At 9:15 he showed up and rang the doorbell.  I was able to see him and talk to him through the doorbell.  He said if I wasn't there in 15 minutes he was leaving as they had a big job to do after mine.  So I left Lowes and drove home.  I got there and he said he didn't have my phone number, so without the doorbell I would not have been able to get the job done that day.  What a great thing to have.  I will say if it is windy the volume on the doorbell is a little low, but if someone gets up close to it, it works fine.  I recommend getting the chime as well which is a plug in chime so you can hear the doorbell inside the house without your phone.<br><br>There is a monthly cost of $3 per ring camera or $30 for the year (the yearly includes a lifetime warranty) if you want Ring to store all video in the cloud.  It has Cloud Storage - Store all of your videos to your Ring account for up to 60 days.  Video Review - If you miss an alert, you can review your videos at anytime. Video Sharing - Share your videos with friends, family or local law enforcement.<br><br>Bottom line I will never own a house again without a ring doorbell.

  I recently installed a Ring Pro doorbell and 2 Cameras. The video is clear and, in general, they perform well.  I have 3 issues that keep me from rating them 5 stars.  The first is that the notification on my iPhone and Apple Watch typically arrive too late to see what is causing the motion alarm in real time.  A few minutes later I can review the video sequence from the beginning but I can't immediately go back to the beginningto see what triggered the alarm.  Second, the cameras seem to be a bit slow in responding and starting to record motion even after I have optimized the motion sensitivity settings.  Finally there does not appear to be a way to clear all notifications at one time on my Apple Watch. It is tedious having to clear them one at a time.

  Unless you like wasting money - stay away from this.  Kinda reminds me of movie with Tom Hanks, “Money Pit”.  Thought I installed incorrectly, have paid an electrician , and had no choice but to remove - ring support sounds good, but it is non-existent - the first time I called was told that “it was still within the window for return”, and for my second call while the electrician was at my house, with ring support on the line, after I explained what was going on, I was asked to respond to an email that was sent and they would get back to me.  The email had approx 10 questions, including one for pictures - all was sent approx 12 hours ago, (glad I was not paying the electrician by the hour) - needless to say, I never received a call back or an acknowledgment of receipt of email.  This doorbell was causing the chime to ring about every 10 secs throughout the day and night - for no reason other than its connection to the ring. If you do not mind total chaos, then that is the product for you.  The review really is for a negative 1 star!! I will return for a refund - totally disgusted with this product and customer service and support!!!!

  I initially bought ring pro in November 2016. Worked OK - 3 stars- for about a year. Always had some problem with actual door bell - only one chime instead of 2 and wifi was spotty with android phone but worked more than not when someone rang and I could see them. Usually the voice worked ok. Then that unit failed one day, the chime got worse and the unit basically stopped worked for any 2 way communications and wifi was terrible. Contacted Ring. They said my ring pro was an older version and corrupted; they sent a brand new ring pro free of charge. I also later ordered ring wifi booster. The door chime never worked properly with ring connected. It worked fine with ring disconnected. I changed the voltage regulator and worked with the ring folks multiple times trying to fix communication issue. no success or improvement. The ring pro rarely worked (video and especially audio) when I got  a phone notification. The wifi was worse than ever. I got a newer Samsung 7. Did not help. I got a new doorbell, one ring approved, No help. If I am in the house the ring usually works. Whenever I am away, hardly ever any reliable or reliable audio. I admit they tried but the system for me, living in a nice area with very good communication services, the ring pro just fails for me. My phone will get the ring, the actual door bell does not function as designed not matter I tried and ring service had me try, the ring wifi booster did nothing one way or the other  (bye 50 bucks) to help with the wifi so in the end I gave it 2 stars and now I am looking for something else. I give up on ring pro.

  Spent over 3 hours trying to install and get Ring working.<br>Problems:<br>1) I knew that the doorbell would be in a tight corner, so I also ordered a set of angle mounts - which were totally unnecessary as two come in the box with Ring Pro!<br>2) The unit has a reset on the right side, so we thought we’d install it with the button on the left - but that doesn’t work because the camera is then upside down!  That should be an easy software fix, am surprised it hasn’t come up before.<br>3) The motion detection setting is very sensitive - was picking up cars passing in the street every couple of minutes, even when set all the way down to “people only”. I finally figured out that the range can be tightened up so that it focuses only on the ground outside the door, which made a huge difference.<br>4) Unit was working then stopped, then would outside but not inside, or would chime at the door, but not alert my iPhone. Changed the network, not much better, will buy an extender to see if that helps to stabilize.<br>Frankly, the jury is still out on whether this purchase is worth the money.

  I purchased a Ring doorbell rather late as many for my neighbors already have them. The Ring Pro was easy to set up and install. It chimes when it detects motion in front of your home. I had no idea we have so much foot traffic in our gated community. The chime does go off frequently; this is good as its working, and bad because it goes off many times a day. I don’t use the night vision because we have an LED dusk to dawn porch light which illuminates well. I like that the Ring has other features such as notifying you of problems in your neighborhood and other Ring users and send out notifications of issues or concerns. They can also share photos and videos! The two-way talk feature works as advertised, and I was surprised how well. The Ring doorbell also has a feature for HOA’s and we plan to activate this option soon. It is a shame that in today's world, devises like this are necessary, but it is. All in all,  I choose Ring over several other choices and I am happy with my decision.

  Update: I'm removing a star b/c Ring refuses to properly moderate the ""Nearby Incidents"" aspect of their app. I have received several notifications in recent days - all of them to do with lost pets or missing packages, none of them involving Ring or any video recorded by ring. Just an extension of Facebook now, apparently.<br><br>Have purchased two Doorbell Pros as well as a Spotlight cam (nearly $700 once sales tax is included - and not including ongoing fees). They are glitchy. After only 48 hours of operation, my front door camera dropped offline (mere feet from the Wi-Fi access point and reports a strong signal) - naturally the Ring help nonsense singled out problems with my network (certainly not their junk!) and suggested that I go remove the cover (behind the ""SECURITY SCREW!"") and reset the device and go through setup again. Wow. Just Wow.<br><br>The intercom ""feature"" is a joke. Sure wish I could swear and still have this review published.<br><br>It takes upwards of three minutes for a recorded event to take place and for a user of the app to be able to view it. Wow. Just Wow.<br><br>If you're looking for true home security, continue your search - Ring is not the answer (get it?).<br><br>Update: Indications are that I have solved the problem of the Doorbell Pros dropping off of the network by upgrading the power transformer to the following product:<br><br>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K2EC7K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br><br>Note that many will require an electrician to perform this upgrade, if required - and your transformer may well be in a tricky location, as mine was found to be. Plan for the trouble and expense, particularly if you plan to hang more than one camera off of your doorbell power transformer.<br><br>The intercom function remains little more than a marketing fantasy - makes for advertising gold, but holds little practical value. Also, the time lag to review a recording remains unacceptably high even with broadband Internet access. Lastly, the motion detection remains impossible to dial in - either you select a sensitivity setting that results in every flake of snow or insect triggering an alert, or you are forced to the ""People Only"" setting which results in alerts not being triggered until someone has potentially been in the camera's field of view for a long time and thus much is missed in the recording.<br><br>You may find value in all of this if you're interested in basic time-lagged video recordings of your property with spotty or over-sensitive motion detection (no Goldilocks setting to be found), but just remember that it is NOT a security system at the end of the day.

  Purchased this wanting it to work, being fully aware of all the lower ratings here on Amazon.  Used Amazon Home Service (will review them separately).  Ring Video Doorbell Pro worked great for three days, such that we were planning on getting some of the cameras.  Lost its signal after three days, came back online and then off a few times, then off permanently.  My wifi router is literally in the room above our front porch, strong signal.<br><br>Ring customer service was responsive, and after I emailed a photo of my doorbell transformer to them, they indicated this was a known problem with under-powered transformers.  They lose points for not making it crystal clear upfront what i would need to have it installed, but the fault in this case is with their installer, who did not enter my house to check it out.<br><br>Purchased a higher volt/amp transformer, had my own electrician install it this morning.  He checked the current with a mulimeter, and it now meets the specifications.  Still can't connect to my network.  The return window will be closing soon, so I am having it removed by the installers, and it is going back.  Will try a Nest Hello.

  Low score due to several reasons. First is the intentional sabotage of Google home/assistant compatibility. That's the absolute biggest reason. Wish Amazon did not buy out ring. This all started because of Amazon lock out of Google services and products from Amazon devices forcing Google's hand. Next is phone battery impacted. Used to finish the day sometimes with 75% battery left. Now need to charge mid day. Third is does not fit well on vinyl siding. About an inch of the bottom hands down below the mounted row. Forth it's no white face plate. Ours considering most houses and door panels are white. Zoom also does not seem to work on recorded videos. Only in live view. No facial recognition. Speaker quality is really bad. Picture is round for some reason. I can see plastic around edges.<br><br>What's good? Pretty good at not triggering motion due to car's driving by. Video quality good and wide enough to see people even if they stand close to door. Install was not too hard. Mic does seem a bit staticy but picks up audio pretty well.

  The ring is awesome. I would recommend this to everyone that wants a little security from package thieves or a little peace of mind. But I give Amazon 0 stars for sending me two duds. The first one I thought it was my transformer and wiring. So I went and bought a new transformer, even though my house was over a year old. That still didn’t work. Had a replacement sent to me using same transformer and it still didn’t work. Then switched back to the oringinal transformer that didn’t work. Now I’m thinking the wiring is too long to supply power or wiring is too small or I hooked it all wrong. Seeing it was a common issue among Ring Pro owners. I looked at all the forums for answers. Then I went to Best Buy and bought one just see if it’s my wiring. Hooked it up, power, BOOM it worked. Thank you Best Buy.

  The integrated install with the existing door bell was outstanding.  I opened the package, finding an impressively organized and complete (including a screwdriver and masonry bit) product.

The install and software are perfect.<br><br>Unfortunately, the product won't work for us since we have a covered porch.

One thing I can recommend is angling the device toward the door a bit more. We do have wedge kits that will do that. Another thing some of our neighbors have found helps is leaving the porch light on during the day to equalize the exposure.""<br><br>While I appreciate his honesty, I am disappointed that the solution was to adapt MY surroundings to RING's needs: change how/where the doorbell sits and leave the lights on 24 hours a day.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great!,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2018","<span>
  Background: Purchased for a new build house in an area without street lights. The doorbell is installed on the front porch, facing a circular driveway.<br>Competition: There are other doorbell cameras out there. I think anyone making a purchase should review all of the choices. In the end, though, I think you will find that this is the leader in this space and offers the best overall solution and, imortantly, look for the front of your home.<br>Out of the Box: Everything I needed was in the box. The instructions were clear and concise. The choice of bezels made matching to the house exterior easy.<br>Install: The install was fast and easy. Took less than 20 minutes. I am handy, especially with electrical and technology, but this can be easily installed by the average handy homeowner.<br>Use: It took a little bit of tweaking to get the camera set just the way we wanted. This was all done in the software. We wanted to make sure we got the right amount of triggers, but not too many. The software has plenty of tools to get you what you want. Overall, it is a little oversensitive,  but we would rather have that than not get triggered. We have not had any security issues, but we have used it to verify deliveries from UPS, USPS, etc. This has been handy especially when travelling and allowed us to remind our college-age son to get the packages off the porch. We have also used it to talk remotely to people at our door and even carried on a conversation with our son's girlfriend and our son while we were vacationing. The only downside is that they have now taken to leaving us funny videos on our doorbell (LOL).<br>Cost: This is not an inexpensive item. When you couple this with the monitoring plan, you will be signing up for ongoing payments. You can use this without the monitoring service, but this limits the features. Where the value really comes is when you buy additional items in the Ring ecosystem. Our insurance carrier gives a discount for monitored alarm systems, so we just bought the Ring Alarm and installed it. The professional monitoring for the alarm is less than the insurance discount and the doorbell monitoring is included. For us, this makes the return on investment a no-brainer.<br>Cellphone Use: There are a lot of factors that can cause you to have a great experience or a poor experience in terms of watching videos live and talking to people. In my humble opinion, most of these are out of Ring's control. It comes down to network speed. I have talked live regularly over LTE, but it doe drop out at times due to network speed, lag, etc. I get consistent performance over WiFi. As some have pointed out, it does take a second to get the application up, but it is fast and I have had no problem responding to a doorbell ring in a normal period of time.<br>In-Home Use: I do think Ring could add more integration for the newer smart technology. My main ask is for a Smart TV App for Android TV and Apple TV.<br>Summary: This is a great way to add security monitoring to your main entrances in an unobtrusive manner. I would recommend this to a friend ( and have ) and would buy this for my family (and have).

  First, I like the excellent support I was given to complete the installation (the first guy was useless and factually wrong but that improved when someone from Ring reaches out directly to me offering help)<br><br>The Amazon Installer service for $99 was *awful* and a complete waste of time. They attended, tried to tell me (more than once) how important it was to plug the doorbell in to charge it a bit before the installer arrived/when he arrived. (Ring Pro has no battery to put on charge). Then on arrival the installer did not want the instructions because he’d done lots of these, and proceeded to not install the power kit in the chime box in the house. When the chime box kept constantly ringing he consulted his manager by phone and they told me the Ring Pro Doorbell was faulty and needed sending back for exchange because it had a short in it.<br><br>Long story short, I canceled the install service, got a refund and installed the same unit myself. It took a lot of effort, needed the advice of a competent support person at Ring, and in the process I ended up needing to replace a transformer and the chime box as I did not know what I was doing at first. But I did install the so called faulty unit and I have a working interior chime and Ring Pro Doorbell.

One issue they have is motion on the street setting it off, so I decided to go with the Pro for its better adjustability.<br><br>Install went as expected, and all seemed well. Within 30 minutes I noticed it wasn't showing online in my phone app. Checked the doorbell and it seemed to be powered off. I triple-checked my wiring, tested the doorbell itself to see that power was still available. When I tested the transformer, I discovered that my builder had used a transformer that didn't have enough voltage for the Ring. It was only showing about 10 volts, while the Ring specifies a minimum of 16 VAC.<br><br>Changed out the transformer, but the doorbell was still dead. Called the support line (it was a Sunday, so waited on hold for a while) and a very knowledgeable tech came on line. We went through all their steps, and it never powered up. It was determined there was a fault with the doorbell. He offered me the choice of them shipping a replacement, or working through Amazon for a replacement. While Amazon could have sent me a replacement faster, I elected to let Ring send it. Again, this was a Sunday. I had my replacement Thursday around Noon.<br><br>Installed the replacement, which worked without a problem. I used the phone app to adjust my motion area, and am pleased that any motion anywhere other than my porch will not trigger.<br><br>Overall very pleased not only with the doorbell itself, but also the customer service I received with the initial defective unit. We also added a Chime upstairs, since the primary doorbell can't be heard very well from there. I haven't had occasion to respond to the doorbell when I'm not home, but I really like having the ability. The video and audio on my phone is outstanding.<br><br>If I could suggest anything to Ring, I would ask for the ability to store the active videos on my own server, rather than using their network. For me, this would ensure I save the videos as long as necessary, simplify file maintenance, and if for some reason my Internet was down they would still be saved on my server.<br><br>Overall a terrific product!

Picked up my WiFi and connected with no issues.<br>After messing around with the settings such as; motion sensitivity, motions zones, etc. I got it to respond to what and where I wanted it to. I did occasionally have to lower the sensitivity because it would pick up my bushes or even my flag blowing in the wind. Not a problem, I must say I do like that it picks up everything and alerts me when someone or something is at my door or in my driveway.<br>Now my problem with this product is the Live View and trying to answer the doorbell when someone rings it. The problem is that that feature is practically useless. I would say 90% of the time I cannot connect to it quick enough to answer the doorbell or to quickly view the reason the motion detection was tripped in the first place. The Live View, when it works, starts out okay then gets pixelated and moving objects just smear across the screen. Unusable. It doesn’t appear to maintain a good connection to my wifi and sometimes there appears to be no connection. Now viewing the recordings afterwards is not a problem, that feature works flawlessly.<br>I’ve troubleshot the crap out of the possible “poor” connection issues to no resolve. The device says that it’s healthy and that my connection is excellent. I have connected from my WiFi and even my WiFi extender which is literally 4 feet from the door that produces excellent signal through out my house resulting the same issues.<br>I don’t care too much about being able to answer the door, but the Live View and the recordings is a key reason as to why I purchased this $200 product.<br>My cameras in and around my house are WiFi connected and I do not have issues with those at all. Occasionally I will get some slowness connecting but not at all like this.<br><br>Overall I can not recommend this without the mentioned issues being fixed. Viewing previous recordings works great and the motion detection also works great but the Live View and the answering of the doorbell itself when someone is actually at the door is a feature that is completely lost...which is basically the purpose of this device right? Maybe I got a bad one?<br><br>Edit: I added two photos from the Ring device during Live View, as you can see in the circled areas how bad the image of a car is driving by the house and what my flag looks like blowing with the breeze.

  I was impressed with the initial concept of a video doorbell device. But Ring fails to tell you that this IoT cloud device is completely dependent on cloud server connectivity. Their devices are WIFI and use very cheap WiFi components. The camera is outside, so WiFi connectivity can be a challenge. Metal doors, metal siding, stone or brick facade, etc can make WiFi connectivity impossible. The DB Pro is a powered camera, but Ring doesn't tell you that many existing doorbell transformers don't provide sufficient amperage to sustain the demands of the DB Pro. If you buy their storage plan, Ring stores your videos in the AWS cloud. Subsequent to my storage purchase, Ring has changed the storage duration. In Aug, Ring changed the device firmware to compress the video and drastically changed the night time functionality of the device, rendering it useless. Instead of informing customers of their plans and priorities, Ring appologiges and thanks us for our patience rather than solving the issues that they have created. Unless you have $250 burning a hole in your pocket, wait five years for the market to weed out the losers, and spend your money for proven products from responsible companies. The Pro doorbell is powered by an internal lipo battery that is recharged via your hardwired doorbell transformer. It is NOT designed as a replaceable component, nor is it properly heatsinked. Thus the unit can run hot and is affected by environmental conditions. Many users are having the battery ""puff"" after a year in service and the only solution is total replacement. And the warranty is...... one year. So plan on replacing your Pro if the lipo fails.....

  Another update. Bought a Ring 720p doorbell. Works much more reliable than ring pro. Alerts work great, main doorbell rings just fine, sound much better. Image quality suffers little from 720p recording. Problem is, the image on this (and others I've seen) washes out completely from bright light. I posted 2 pictures. The first is from my video doorbell at noon time. The second is from my $24, 720p wireless camera 5 feet away from my doorbell, same time. Why can't you manually adjust brightness and contrast on ring doorbells? Outrageous!<br><br>I returned this Ring pro for the following reasons. First, let me qualify my setup. I have a professional wireless AP that covers 12 homes in my neighborhood. My Ring was ~30 feet from my AP and had a signal of 100%. I installed the ring with the doorbell transformer that Ring suggests. My regular doorbell rang every time with my Ring Pro. I run 2 other $59 720p wireless cameras without any issues at all. Having said that. The Ring pro sound is terrible, choppy and intermittent at best. It was great at listening (could hear people talk across the street) but useless to talk to your visitor. I had a lot of trouble connecting to ""Live View"". I would wait maybe 10 seconds to connect. If I was away from my home my alerts worked great but forget connecting to ""live view"" using 4G. Never worked once. RING -At this price for a doorbell I want everything to be puppy dogs and rainbows.<br><br>Installation - do your research! You MUST have enough bandwidth to operate this camera. You MUST have a strong wifi signal at the doorbell. You MUST have the correct transformer to have the camera and your doorbell both ring. These are all technical requirements that MUST be met. Missing any one of these will result in hours of aggravation trying to figure out why your ring doesn't work as advertised. Once I confirmed that I met all these requirements (I needed a new transformer), the installation was pretty straightforward. Working with the cheap plastic wedge blocks was somewhat aggravating.  It would help if you could snap these together like legos. When I wired the camera up it started as expected. I still had a lot of work to do before completing the installation. All this time the camera was recording me in high def and uploading the video to their servers. I'm talking about over 100 gigs of video! My LAN was crawling on its knees. The app was freezing constantly. I have 300 mbps internet connection and it took 5 hours before the camera stabilized!<br><br>Operation - The app works fine (if your phone is powerful enough to run it) and has all the settings you need to control behavior of the camera. I'm very impressed with the motion controls. I rarely get false motion alerts. I got ONE last night due to a bug crawling on the wall very close to the ring. My main complaint about the ring is the poor audio quality though turning on the audio I can hear people talking across the street.<br><br>In closing - l wish that Ring would offer a 720 resolution option. It's not that much loss in image quality and uses half the amount of bandwidth as an 1080. I don't need to see across the street with my Ring and don't think you will see a license plate with a 1080p camera. I only need to see who (or what Mr cat) is at my door. It would also be cheaper than the 1080p Ring. I bought my Ring during Amazon Prime days. I would never pay full price for this Camera. At the end of the day this pro cam is now working great and I enjoy the security it adds to my home. Always catches the UPS and mailman without fault. I was rather disappointed that Ring does not timestamp the video itself. The timestamp is in the filename. A great camera, all in all, but for the price it should be the BEST hands down.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Replacement but New doorbell is different size!!!!!,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2020","<span>
  I've been very upset with my second Ring doorbell purchase due to the fact it doesn't charge through the existing doorbell wiring.  My original Ring was great, it never needed to be charged.  This one must be taken down every month for a recharge from my computer.  I'm fed up with Ring number 2 so I purchased the Ring Pro thinking it would be the replacement I wanted.  I spend a lot of time reading the instructions, installing the transformer, taking the old ring off the wall then I notice the new one doesn't have the same footprint as the old one (only two years old)!  Why would a company do this?  Since the old plate has 4 screws that bore into my stucco finish and none of the screw holes even line up (in case I could use at least one side of the old installation).  If there are various sizes at least provide a plate that can be used for the smaller versions!!!  Very aggravated right now.  Amazon really screwed up a good company when they bought out Ring!

  I purchased the pro version. So far, so good. Installation was simple and to the point. I purchased the angled wall plates and it is pointed exactly where I need it to be. I also have 8 2k surveillance cameras recording 24/7 so this is not the only video recording device I have, it merely accompanies the other cameras. Recorded footage is okay at best, not good or great. My mechanical door chime is approximately 2 seconds behind the press of the Ring button. According to Ring, you need 3900mV of power running to the doorbell. I fluctuate from 3880 - 3996 (not sure if this is a transformer issue, wiring issue, or Ring issue). Full wifi signal through stucco/brick wall (40 feet from Ring to router). Motion settings appear to be working well. I threw some silicone around the mounting plate just to be sure as the stucco wall is not even. I am getting alerts for motion and rings straight to my phone within .5 seconds of activity, I will update if this changes in the future. All in all, I would purchase again and will recommend this to those who listen. Also, there is a neighborhood beta program that allows Ring users to network together (sort of a digital crime watch network) and share footage of suspicious people at their door. This is outstanding and well worth the purchase price in itself.<br><br>UPDATE: Up and running for 3 months now with no issues. Only had one false motion alert in 3 months. So far, so good!

  ****Edited Review****<br><br>I originally wasn’t too happy with the video quality.  I recently decided to contact them and I worked with someone there to troubleshoot several things and eventually she came to the conclusion that my doorbell had some voltage issues so she promptly ordered a replacement for me.  After installing it she ran more checks and updated the firmware and the video quality is finally like I originally expected!!!  I only wish I had tried to reach out sooner!<br><br>Ring has also made a lot of updates to the apps and products which have all been for the better.  I’ve been lucky to be a part of many beta tests including the alarm and outside of enjoying doing those tests, it has shown just how serious Ring is about their consumers.  The app and hardware and anything you can think of go through very rigorous testing by people who buy these products and use them.  Ring takes every suggestion and bug seriously and I’ve witnessed new products or apps go from ok to great in a matter of weeks.  If there’s one thing more important than the product itself it’s the company and their support.  Ring has impressed myse and my wife more than any other company. Both in seeing their resolve to get their products right and the best in the industry and as a consumer myself needing to work with support on issues.  There will always be issues and things break, but it’s how the company handles those and they take it seriously and offer best in class service and support.<br><br>I left my old review below for transparency about my original thoughts but I can 100% say I couldn’t be happier.<br><br>If you have any questions about any product including their alarm fee free to ask me as I have worked with them a lot and tested and would be happy to help others see the benefit in their products that we do.<br><br>***Old Review***<br><br>Other than video quality, which is why I gave it 4 stars, we love the Ring Pro.  Luckily we bought it more for looks than video quality.<br><br>Like many have posted, video quality isn't really HD.  I didn't have the original ring so I can't compare to it.  It's definitely not my internet as my speed test during install was over 200 Mbps.  I attached my speed test.<br><br>Outside of video quality it's a great product.  The design is much better than the first one and doesn't look as big and bulky.<br><br>So far the motion zones have worked really wel and sound quality has been good.<br><br>All in all we really like it but just wish the video quality was a little better and closer to advertised.

3.0 out of 5 stars,BEWARE! NOT AS ADVERTISED! DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT 19VAC,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2017","<span>
  The Ring advertisements/documentation claim that the Ring Video Doorbell Pro (RDP) will work with a line voltage of 16-24VAC. Given this claim, I purchased this product and proceeded to follow the manufacturer's installation instructions. When I tried to do the link to my WiFi, the doorbell would not stay connected/on. After about a minute, the RDP system would shut down. I measured the voltage at the doorbell location with a Fluke DMM and found I was getting a steady 19.4 VAC, well above the low end of the claimed voltage range of 16-24VAC claimed by Ring. After further troubleshooting, I could not determine what was the cause of this problem. As I typically do in like times, I turned to online forums. One thing I have learned over the past decade is that the online community typically has better, UNBIASED knowledge than product manufacturers!<br><br>As usual, the online forums came to the rescue. It seems to be well-documented that in some cases the RDP will NOT function with anything under 24 VAC. There are several online forum contributors that through their own experiences discovered this issue. In fact, at least one individual was told by Ring Technical Assistance to buy a particular Elk brand 24 VAC transformer (available on Amazon) to remedy the power-on issue. What this means is that Ring is aware of the issue, yet they have NOT changed their claim the the RDP works with a line voltage of 16-24 VAC, nor have they corrected the issue. In fact, that rectangular device that is included with the product is some sort of capacitor that is suppose to store voltage from, I assume, a 16VAC line and feed it to the RDP. It does work for about a minute and then the voltage must drop under the 16VAC threshold. What I suspect in my particular case, is that my low voltage wiring must not be thick enough (house built in 1990) to carry enough current to the RDP. Regardless, the RDP did NOT work as advertised with 19.4VAC. Maybe the Ring engineers need to better understand that voltage and current are not the same thing?<br><br>In my particular case, it cost me an additional $45-$50 in order to get the RDP to function! This included purchasing the Ring recommended Elk transformer AND a Ring Doorbell Chime!!! Why did I buy the Ring Chime? Try finding a doorbell chime that works with 24 VAC! Yes, of course, I had to purchase Ring's chime because my existing 16 VAC chime would not work with the Elk 24 VAC transformer. Hmmmmm..., I wonder if Ring's marketing department planned this this whole scenario out??? Let's see, we sell them the doorbell, force them to buy our chime, and then take away the recording feature and make them pay us $30 per year...<br><br>In summary, I cannot award Ring anything higher than 3 stars. Although it is a great product. I just wish that they hadn't resorted to American corporate greed. They have been untruthful in their advertisements. They also pretty much force you into purchasing their chime. And, they also give you claim that the RDP will record (keep a record) of motion/doorbell ring videos. What they don't tell you upfront is that this is true, ONLY FOR 30 DAYS!!! After the ""trial period,"" they want customers to pay them $30 per year for being able to record events!!! Talk about corporate greed...

2.0 out of 5 stars,Inconsistent Alerts,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2019","<span>
  The new Ring video doorbell pro is more expensive than comparable products on the market, which I don't mind if the product lives up to the higher cost. I chose this camera mainly because I have other Ring products and didn't want to bother with multiple apps by buying a different brand. First, I really don't like having to pay annual fees PER camera!!! It's costly additional expense that you don't have with most other brands. With great signal strength, the video quality is just OK, not great. Installation was simple. As with all other Ring cameras, there's a significant delay for live view if the camera is busy (e.g. immediately after motion notification or weaker signal). I can live these flaws but the biggest flaw of the this doorbelll pro is the inconsistent motion alerts. I get immediate notices approx. 40% of the time, about a minute or more later 35% of the time and NO alerts the other 25% of the time. This is unacceptable as the most important feature (for me) is to be notified immediately when there's a person at the door. I will keep this for another week or so to see if the alert feature improves. One of the reasons Ring products cost so much more is because they include EVERYTHING (except the kitchen sink) with each camera. This doorbell pro came with 3 additional covers, 2 slant/tilt plates, extra plate with balance thingy, screw driver with dual heads, all type of screws, drill bit, etc. They could lower the price of each camera if some of these accessories were optional. I don't plan to use additional covers, plates, I have many screw driver &amp; bits, etc.

  Yes, it does have an internal battery. Read all about it here on Reddit: reddit.app.link/H7XHWPZyAO<br><br>If you want to use this with a mechanical chime, it will work for maybe a year or so, then your only option will be to use a Ring Chime or Amazon Echo to hear your doorbell. There are many, many reports of this on internet forums like Reddit. There is an internal battery that is non-replaceable that wears out over time, faster when exposed to weather not found in California (e.g. cold winters in the midwest, very hot summers in the southwest).<br><br>Also, your existing wiring is insufficient. You will have to upgrade your existing doorbell transformer to 16V-30va. Most houses only have 16V-10va.<br><br>Your internet uplink may also be insufficient. When I bought mine, the documentation said 1MB up was a fast enough internet connection, but in reality you need minimum 2MB uplink (upload speed, not download speed).<br><br>Ring sent me a free Ring Chime after admitting that ""a capacitor wears out over time"", but we didn't want a digital chime that has be connected to Wifi just to hear our doorbell. If you don't care how your doorbell sounds, then you'll be fine. But part of the reason I bought the $250 Ring Pro was to use my mechanical doorbell, and I expected to be able to do so for many years, not 2. This was not made clear in the product description. These devices should be replaced by the manufacturer.

The door bells are good at making a lot of noise on my phone when I am in my office with patients, but when I try to connect to the cameras to talk to the person (United States Postal Servies, visitor, etc)... (despite the fact that I have Verizon Fios ultrafast routers) , the Ring takes so long to connect and give an image that in only 1/10 tries, can I actually see the visitor live before they have walked out of sight.

  Ordered in November 2017 and after a few minor hitches due to my particular setup, it was up and running. In August 2018 a package was stolen off my porch two minutes after UPS delivered it and thanks to the Ring video and a neighbor who obtained a tag number, the item was recovered. In January 2019 the unit went offline for most of one evening, and efforts to get it running again were met with limited success. The next morning it went offline again, and after extensive troubleshooting, I called Ring, and after hearing my problem, they shipped me the latest version at no charge even though the unit was out of warranty. Apparently, there is a problem with a non-replaceable battery in the version I had. Oddly enough, the old Ring started working again on its own and continued to work until the replacement arrived. Installing the replacement was easy, and in no time it was up and running. The night image on the replacement seems better than on the 2017 model. The biggest issue I have is the shape of the street in front of my house. Car headlights often strike the Ring directly and can trigger a motion alarm. After extensive experimentation with the motion zones and sensitivity, I have greatly reduced that problem, and it still alerts properly on anyone approaching my porch.<br><br>The bottom line is I'm very happy with the Ring and the few times I've called customer support, the experience has been pleasant, and this device deserves a 5-star rating.

  Overall we've enjoyed our Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is my first Ring seemed to be defective and I had to have it replaced.

From quick responses to no questions asked replacement the customer service has been great.  The service alone would make me recommend a ring.<br><br>On the device itself it's been great.

  Ring does what it says. If you save video or send by text/email you pay $30 a year for cloud storage. I was wondering if it would be better than just having a security camera on the porch. I found WIFI signal was stanky on the porch so had to add Netgear signal booster near the door. The video/sound was skipping without it. The Pro version allows setting custom motion zones. So it doesnt record every time a car drives by or Rusty the Raccoon visits. I had a sketchy ""solicitor"" recorded yesterday &amp; noticed my daughter leaving for work late today. I set to alert me on rings only, not motion. I dont want a text everytime the kids take out the trash. (Like never). Using current wires is nice so never changing batteries. Used black base plate because I think it looks better &amp; thats all I have to say about that. Only complaints: 1) The install app is for the standard version, not the Pro. 2) I wish it had a larger lense so no ""fisheye"" feeling. 3) Voice talking back &amp; forth from the phone app has delay &amp; speaker is not high quality. Suggestion to Ring: make a ""Pro Plus"", bigger &amp; better video/audio speaker. I have plenty of room on the wall. I will still need to decide if it is better than just having a super HD camera on the porch.

  With optimal conditions it works well. IF it is dark out, motion alerts DO NOT WORK. It is a known issue to Ring and one they cannot figure out.

  This is a followup review on my ring doorbell pro. My first review (below) was pretty poor with 2 stars. After putting up with a poor and inconsistent performance for nearly a year, I broke down and called Ring support. Ring support, with my permission, took control of my doorbell and ran a diagnosis test on the system and said I had a defective bell. Ring offered to replace the bell at no-charge and sent it two-day shipping  So this is how the bell should work? It's awesome. I wish I would have called earlier. A properly working Ring Bell is very impressive. Thank you Ring Team. OLD REVIEW: Ring Doorbell Pro was easy to install. Video on Ring website made it easy...takes about 30 minutes. I've owned the Ring doorbell for about 4 months now. Its a quality product, well made and looks nice. The video, when working is clear and sharp. The app is another issue entirely. Many issues connecting when motion is detected or someone rings your doorbell. As an example, today I received an alert that someone rang my doorbell. I attempted to connect via my iPhone and all I received was a black video. Had no idea who was at my door. Once I arrived home, I found a UPS package. Halloween night was a mess. I wasn't home and numerous detected motions and rings; resulting in a blank video. The doorbell works about 80-90% of the time. The rest of the time, I'm left in the dark about who is at my front door. Since all of my videos are saved on the Ring cloud, I can show Ring folks the many problems I have had. There is a health report for the device and it shows a strong wi-fi signal and the power for the device shows very good. I expected better performance from an expensive product. I rated the product 2 stars. If you talk to Ring and give them a chance, you'll be a satisfied customer.

  I've been very happy with having the Ring Video Doorbell (Pro).  I feel more secure while at home and really like being able to check on what's going on outside my home while away.  If money were no object I would have two additional flood light cams and a couple of stickup cams inside my house as well - these things are perfect.  I've already shared my experience with a co-worker whom is having a house built and he already knows the locations on the house he is going to install Ring products!  The only thing I recommend is to get the Ring Chime Pro as well since it does an excellent job at boosting the video doorbells connection and I had a noticeable improvement on my video quality once I got the Chime Pro (plus the added chimes are a pretty cool benefit).<br><br>Also, Ring's customer service has been great to me personally, but don't do it through email.  Email was too slow and not enough can get done between emails for it to be effective. Call them!  My Ring Pro stopped working and the customer service agent on the phone quickly resolved the issue and sent me a replacement device for free.  They also sent me the Chime Pro since they noticed that my old device broke during a firmware update and they wanted to make sure to alleviate any network connection issues in the future.  Now having tried the Ring Chime Pro I highly recommend people pay the $$ and get it!  If I ever needed another one I sure would, it's worth it for the increased connection strength.

  You'll find a lot of unhappy reviews for this device.  Mostly, folks complaining that they couldn't get it to work, or, that it died early.  The problems could have been:  their WiFi was weak, or, their chime voltage was low, but most likely, the unit simply failed.  I had two bad units, and two very painful experiences getting them replaced by customer support (who insisted I had terrible WiFi, and/or terrible chime voltage.  Both which are actually well over spec).  When they sent the third unit, the guy mentioned that the 'Pro' had gone through several design iterations, and the latest rev seems to work much better.  I installed the third unit, and it's working just fine.  Sad that they decided to ship the early units without wringing out all of the bugs.  Wish I had known I was a beta tester, I would have rated the product higher.  And now that it works, I find that it's a useful device, but not a life-changer.  It's most useful while at work or on vacation, to let bad guys think you are at home when they check out your house.  Other than that, yawn.

It frequently wouldn't ring the doorbell in the house (mechanical bell). Would lose WiFi connection or not recognize motion. I upgraded the power transformer that fed power to it to make sure it had plenty of power, still unreliable.<br><br>We also purchased one of Ring's Stick Up cams, and it would randomly emit a terrible loud screeching sound that almost sounded like the alarm, but was just a malfunction of some kind.

  Do not buy a Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  I've had it about 6 months and I've had nothing but problems.  First one was DOA and I exchanged it directly with RING.  The second one has very poor audio.  I can't hear or understand anyone standing at my front door and they can't hear me speaking to them very well either. The app on windows is very limited compared to the Android app. I have the same problems on both though.  Their support people are useless too.  After they go through their basic troubleshooting checklist they can't do anything else and stop responding to emails.  When you call, they always try to have you do something that makes you wait for a reset or update just to get you off the phone.  They tell you to call back or email with the result but then you get someone else trying to help and start the process all over again.

  My husband has been eyeing these for a while and with friends great reviews and those online I finally broke down and bought one for his bday.  Plus with sleeping babies in the house I was sick of morons not reading our 'don't ring the doorbell' sign and ringing the doorbell anways.<br><br>It was a bit harder to install than they claim, but still pretty easy.  I will note here that it was amazing that they provided everything needed for install, right down to the drill bit and tiny screwdriver.  However I wantes to mention the tiny level built it the wall plate was not level.  Not a huge deal for us because we have several lying around, but others who would only rely on the plate might end up with a crooked doorbell so I suggest checking it on something flat (kitchen counter top for example) before you begin.<br><br>Once installed we tested the positioning (we bought an angle plate so we needed to find the right angle) and during this process we could immediately see the video quality was very poor.  If the person is standing still it's adequate, but if there is any movement forget it, it's a hot mess.  Its grainy and pixelated and trailing pixels for the movement, really low quality stuff and I'm shocked, at this price point the quality is no where near what your paying for.  And since no one will ever be standing perfectly clear it pretty much renders the video feed worthless in my opinion.  My $100 baby monitor in my kids rooms is 10 times higher quality than this....<br><br>And the lag time other people mention is definitely an issue.  Between the 15/30 second lag getting the notification from the door bell, THEN the 30/45 second lag time of the app opening, over a minute has gone by and I can guess most people may leave/start to walk away by then.  You could then use the audio talk feature to potentially call our to them and hope they come back, but unfortunately that's also very poor.  Its garbled mess, thwy can hear you much better than you can here them.<br>On several tests we ran the person answering the door on the phone cannot understand a single wood the person at the door is saying.  We tried on two different phones and in several places and you couldn't understand anything.  So what am I paying for, a horrible video, horrible audio and a extreme lag time that you likely will miss many people?! Ridiculous.<br><br>And this is clearly noted on the amazon  description and product packaging that it works with Alexa but it doesnt, not from any of our 3 alexa devices, or app on phones.  From the actual Ring website it says it only works with the Show, so there is some false advertising on the amazon listing.<br><br>Now on to the Ring app, thought it has many good features to fine tune the motion zones and settings, there are several that are dumb or don't do what it should.  And probably most problematic is you can only have one owner account/user.  When most people have 2 adults/parents in a house I feel you should have at least 2 accounts with full rights/access.  But nope.  So now my husband doesn't get full access to all the settings and ability to change things, like if he wants to turn back on the in-house doorbell when the kids wake from naps he has to call or text me to do it because he doesn't have access.  Complete crap.  And last night we got constant motion notifications from things that were outside our zone, i finally realized that it was lights from cars - even though the car wasn't in the zone the headlights tripped the zones, and from 10 houses down when the cars would turn a corner.  So the only way to get this to stop was to turn off the motion alerts which totally defeats the purpose and thus provides no security at night, or you turn off your phone volume -which we know won't be an option for many people  (jobs where you are on call, or have to leave the phone on for emergency calls from family etc).<br><br> For the price you pay this device and app is NOT worth it, definitely not worth $250, MAYBE $100....  Definitely bummed.  And if this last only 2 years like many of the reviews mention I'll be super upset.<br><br>The only reason we are not returning it is because we want the doorbell off when the kids are napping, but be able to have a way to know someone is at the door.  And if we weren't living in Arizona I would have gone with the Nest which is much higher quality and records 24/7, but not rated past 100 degrees so wouldn't work here in phoenix, so this was pretty much our only option...

3.0 out of 5 stars,Functions as an alarm clock if you want to get up at dawn.,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2018","<span>
  I’ve only had it a short while but it seems to function correctly, installation/setup was easy and, except for one condition, false motion alarms don’t happen. The exception to this last item is a rather irksome one. I’ve had other cameras that attempted to detect motion but the software could not decern variable lighting changes from true motion. The ring mostly handles this except when the infrared lights are turned off at dawn. Every morning at dawn the Ring throws an alarm. This never should’ve passed QC.<br><br>It is hard to believe that the firmware is not notified, or most likely in control, of a switch from infrared lighting. It seems that a 2 second (or whatever settling period is required) suspension of motion detection would fix this if a more elegant solution is unavailable. For instance, this thing is connected to the Internet where both time and dawn info are available. If the firmware is not notified of the lighting switch then shame on the hardware designer.<br><br>BTW, don’t tell me to manually suspend motion detection around this daily changing period or reduce sensitivity.

  When it works, it's great.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work 80% of the time.  It's either dropping it's wifi signal, despite my router literally sitting on the other side of the wall.  Or, it's losing power inadvertently and for absolutely no reason.  That's just simply unacceptable for a $200 product that is sold and marketed to protect your home.  My Ring spotlight cam and security system don't have anywhere near the troubles the Pro Doorbell has.  Considering all the unnecessary headaches, I'm starting to believe this is simply a novelty product and has absolutely no need on my home.  I'm spending another afternoon this week trouble shooting this thing and if it doesn't start working better than it has, I'm boxing it up and sending it back.  I've never had a smart home product this troublesome and tiresome.<br><br>Edit for 6/24/19 -<br><br>A couple days after writing this review, a representative from Ring reached out to me to see what he could do to help with my connectivity issues.  After monitoring the doorbell for a day and doing some diagnostics, he realized something wasn't right with my doorbell and offered to send me a replacement.  So, I am adjusting my review to three stars based on exceptional customer service (5 stars on customer service, Ring has been a pleasure to deal with).  The replacement unit should arrive in the next several days and hopefully, I can adjust my final rating.  Because I really do enjoy my doorbell and the peace of mind it provides when it is connecting appropriately.  I'll update once everything is installed.<br><br>Edit for 7/11/19<br><br>Updating my original review.  Ring was terrific to deal with regarding my first unit, which turned out to be a faulty unit.  They ended up overnighting me a replacement unit and pre-paid packaging to send mine back once the replacement was installed.  Not only did they do all this, but kept in contact with me to ensure that the new unit was working as it should.  Which it was.  Since receiving the new Pro, my WiFi connection has not been dropped once and it's been installed for over two weeks.  I absolutely love having this thing, in addition to our other Ring cameras and security system.  Rings customer service really deserves 6 or 7 stars for making this right for me.  Thanks Ring!

  I think this is a great product, and surprisingly simple to set up.  Initially I had the same issues as some report (freezing stuttering video, lag time for video to start filming, loss of wifi, etc).  There are two common problems, and I had both of them:<br><br>1)  insufficient voltage at the device, even though I had an 18 volt transformer.  For some reason their customer support blames a) old transformer and b) old wires.  Since a transformer is just two coils of wire, my simple mind says it should work or not work.  I don't see how it gets weak.  And I don't see old wires restricting voltage.  Copper merely gets surface oxidation, not into the wire.<br><br>But, surface corrosion at all connections will indeed impede current flow, so I cleaned all connections with sandpaper to get shiny copper, and life was good.  The device now rated its voltage health as ""very good""<br><br>2)  Wifi signal strength.  According to the device my wifi strength was not good, but acceptable, and the doorbell did indeed work, but there was quite a time lag for the camera to work, and the video did often freeze.  I installed a range extender (repeater) for my wifi, and now the ring works perfectly.  Video hooks up nearly instantly, and never stutters or freezes.<br><br>Now, after doing the above, I had to switch wifi on the doorbell to have it connect to the repeater wifi.  This is starting setup as if it were a new device.  And from start to finish, it couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes.<br><br>So.... while you are waiting for your ring to arrive, clean your connections from transformer to old doorbell, and make sure you have a good strong signal at the bell location.<br><br>Then when your ring arrives, you'l have it up and working perfectly in just a couple of minutes with no frustration!

  Thumbs up to Ring.  I read an online comparison of Ring vs. Skybell, and chose Skybell.  I was able to install Skybell very quickly (less than 10 minutes).  I was pleased with the product, but with one exception.  The motion detection was way too sensitive (even on “low” sensitivity setting).  Cars passing my house triggered a notification and video alerts every 2-3 minutes.  It was so bad, I had to disable motion detection (so as not to trigger alerts on my iPhone ever 2-3 minutes all night long, for example).  I contacted Skybell to see if there was a way to address the problem, but Skybell support was completely non-responsive.<br><br>I decided to try Ring, to see if it has better motion detection configuration.  After a few installation hiccups (see below), I’m happy to report that Ring is working just fine.  As to motion detection, the app lets you establish a motion “zone” of detection.  I set the zone to target the front door area, but to ignore/cut off the street, hoping that no passing cars would trigger motion detection.  It worked!!  I’m very pleased with Ring, and how it only alerts me of a person approaching my house.<br><br>Now, as to the installation hiccups….  I received the Ring, and set out to install it.  It is more complex to install than Skybell, but with patience I was able to do it (so I thought).  The in-app video installation guide helps teach you how to install the device.  However, once installed, the device would not power up.  I called Ring support.  It was Sunday evening, and I assumed they likely would be closed.  Wrong!  Not only were they open (24x7), but the service rep patiently helped trouble-shoot for almost an hour.  He was very professional.  Ultimately, he determined that the device was defective, and agreed to ship me a replacement unit (even though I had purchased from Amazon, and not from Ring!).  A few days later, I received Ring unit #2, and set out to install it.  I was happy to see that the device powered up (unlike unit #1).  However, the device would not broadcast a WiFi signal (to connect to my iPhone, a mandatory installation step).  I called support, and once again an agent helped trouble-shoot the issue.  Unfortunately, once again, the agent determined that unit #2 was defective.  So they shipped me unit #3.  When it arrived, I decided this would be the last chance I would give Ring.  Luckily, unit #3 powered up, and also broadcast a WiFi signal, allowing the unit to complete the installation process.  Now that I have a working unit, I am very pleased with Ring.  And, the wonderful quality of support was a DRASTIC contrast to Skybell’s complete non-responsiveness.  Way to go, Ring!

  I installed the Ring Pro this afternoon, after reading some of the materials, watching two or three YouTube videos and reading several reviews from previous customers.  I also looked at the illustrations in the instruction book that came with the unit.  They were somewhat helpful but since the book I received was written in FRENCH, they were what I had to go with.<br><br>After making sure all needed materials were in the box (they were), I headed to the breaker box to turn off current to the doorbell.  I didn't expect to find one marked ""doorbell"" so I wasn't disappointed that it wasn't there.  I began the process of turning off a breaker, trying the doorbell (ding dong), turning that breaker back on and repeating the process for all breakers except heating/air, washer/dryer and water heater.  Never did find the breaker for the doorbell so back to the web to see how ""hot"" doorbell current is.  It turned out that it probably wouldn't kill me so I put on a pair of rubber gloves, just in case, and carefully proceeded hooking things up as instructed.  All in all, installation was a piece of cake and, wonder of wonders, it all seems to be working as advertised.  I had to mount the unit on brick so had to use the masonry bit.  If I hadn't already had a power drill, I would have had to buy one but no big deal either way.<br><br>Bottom line:  So far I'm very pleased with this thing and I just purchased the first year's worth of video cloud storage that will kick in when my 30 day free service ends.<br><br>The phone app was a little buggy to start with but after three or four tries, it all fell into place.  I later installed it on my wife's phone with no problem.

  great product, Hardware quality needs improvement ! I had to change THREE of them for various reasons. First one could not connect to Wifi. The second would get hung during the setup process and had to be reset multiple times and was replaced and finally the third one again had issues connecting to Wifi. I finally got one that was setup as expected.<br>I am a network engineer and understand the ins and out of wifi. I suspect the hardware manufacturing quality is not there for this mass-produced device and it needs serious improvement.<br>Once setup the device works well. I have also installed two chimes that were also installed easy and work well. I put one in the front of the house and another towards the back. Having two allows me to keep the volume relatively low in each location and still hear the doorbell throughout the house.<br>Three stars may be a rough rating for this innovative product. However, I feel spending many hours with their helpful support folks must be taken into consideration to properly rate this product. If they get it right, I may buy other products they make. Until then, I am in a wait and see mode.

  The unit worked perfectly for about three hours and then failed/died.  I spent several hours going through all the trouble shooting steps I could find on-line to no avail.  I called Ring’s technical support and they had me go through all the same steps to trouble shoot the unit that I had done before.  The end result from Ring was, the installation is correct and yes the unit is not working and needs to be replaced.  The unit comes with a one year warranty, but a big ‘Buyer Beware’ is in order.  You need to take pictures of your installation and have it verified before they will accept the return.  In my case, I could provide pictures of everything except the door bell transformer in the attic.  I’m sure it was covered up years ago when I had extra insulation installed.  No picture of the transformer, which I would imagine needs to include the power rating label, no return.  I could provide the voltage reading at the unit which was within their specifications, but they want to verify the VA rating of the transformer.  In summary, nice unit when it’s working, but you will need to verify installation with pictures for Ring to honor their warranty.

  I bought this because I had some Amazon items stolen from my mailbox.  Time to get a camera.  So I chose this one due to the higher quality of the video.  I like it that it has night vision too, so I can see when their is someone in my yard at night.  I'm still getting used to some of the options like the Motion detector and setting the motion sensitivity.  The only complaint I would have about this is the motion detection doesn't reach my mail box, which is across the street in front of my house.  I tried walking in front of the mailbox and it didn't catch me.  But it will catch a car in the street, so hopefully the thieves are i n a vehicle if they steal my mail.  Another thing is that my old doorbell doesn't ring inside when the doorbell is rung.  I haven't troubleshooted this yet, so I won't put this as a negative thing yet.  I'll try to update the inside ringer as soon as I get to looking for the problem.

  Very pleased with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro.....<br><br>Installation - The installation video was helpful as I'm not known as a DIY'er. Very glad it came with the tools needed to connect it to our chime and doorbell. I had to sit their/Ring's chime on top of our chime box because I could not close the cover with the Ring chime in it. Not a big deal as you can barely see it on top of our chime box. Total install time for me was around 25 minutes as I had to drill one hole due to the Ring Doorbell's holes not lining up with the holes from our original doorbell. But again, I'm not a pro. Someone with better handyman skills could probably get it done faster. Even so, the installation videos were very well done and helpful.<br><br>Configuration - Downloaded the app to my phone, my wife's phone and her tablet. Added the Ring doorbell within the apps then it took a few minutes for the Ring doorbell to start functioning as it was updating its firmware. I configured the motion sensors on my wife's tablet and we were good to go. Took about 10 minutes to complete the app installation and configuration process.<br><br>Performance - We have a solid 18Mbps wireless internet connection and the signal is strong throughout the our 1800 square foot house. Due to the strong signal, the ""Live View"" video is excellent - very clear and crisp on all three devices (2 Samsung phones and one Windows 10 tablet). Please note the Ring Video app is not available for Windows 7. The sound quality using my older Samsung phone is not that great. But my wife's Galaxy S5 and Windows 10 tablet is good....not great, but should we really expect it to sound like a Bose stereo system? lol.<br><br>The notifications received on our phones and tablet after a motion trigger is less than 1 - 2 seconds on average at our house - nearly instantaneous which is great. When I'm at work it takes about 2 -3 seconds on average.....voice quality is still good and the video quality over 4G is excellent.<br><br>Now, the downside is connecting to ""Live View"" (viewing whenever you want) is hit and miss. Sometimes we can connect and sometimes we cannot. Not sure why that is and I'm not in a hurry to ask their support as I have heard about their untimely responses. The workaround has been to view a past video from a Ring notification and then go to ""Live View"". That has worked for us every time - without fail. I know it does not make a lot of sense, but that workaround simply works.<br><br>All in all, we are very pleased with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro and will highly recommend it. Brings peace of mind for me and my family and that's extremely important to me. A few of my co-workers have seen how it works via my phone and are planning to purchase it.<br><br>Quick shipment for a good, ""peace of mind"" product......

  Very disappointed in the performance of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  Installation was relatively easy but performance is spotty.  For the first time ever, I had a pkg stolen from my front door.  UPS said it was delivered but nothing was recorded of them delivering it or anyone taking it  I've had the same delivery guy for a long time and have no reason to doubt that he delivered it..  A friend stopped by to see if I was home (I wasn't) and it didn't record that, either.  There is often quite a delay between the time something is recorded and it's available to view.  Sometimes as much as 20 minutes, which kind of defeats the purpose.  My signal strength is good to excellent so it's not that.  I ordered a Chime Pro anyway, to try to boost my signal strength.  Interestingly enough, the delivery of that was also not recorded.  :-)  It seems to selectively record events because most of the time deliveries are recorded, as are cars or people coming up my driveway.  I am unable to complete the setup of the Chime to know if it helps the doorbell because I would have to remove the cover by unscrewing the safety screw on the doorbell so I can link it to the Chime.  It's January in Minnesota with below zero temps so that's not happening for a while.  I would probably return the doorbell but, again, it's too cold to remove it and my return window will be up soon.  So, I wouldn't recommend buying this doorbell, with or without the boost of a Chime.  It's a nice idea and the quality of the video is good when it records but it's just too unreliable.

  My wife and I both love this Doorbell. I waited several weeks to review the Ring Doorbell Pro (Slim Profile) to do a review on this product. Beginning with the Kit itself, includes the Ring Doorbell, four face plates, a Pro Power Kit, a Drill bit, Screw Driver (one side is Philips head driver, pull that out of the driver, turn it around and it has the head to screw head to tighten the doorbell cover on)  I left the existing Doorbell in place, and also put in the Ring Chime upstairs. In the kit which comes with the doorbell it has very easy to install instructions. Always begin by downloading the App on the phone you use to set up the door bell (which is available for Apple, Android, and Windows. My wife has an iPhone 6S, I have the Galaxy S8 +) Then begin on the inside doorbell if you intend to keep it (recommended), Ring Pro has it's own very easy to install Power Kit (it sends more DC current for the camera to mount inside the existing doorbell.<br><br>Ring recommends you turn the breaker off to the doorbell, if you are experienced working with live 110/120v AC, I didn't bother with the breaker (I have some wire clamps to shield one from getting stung), some existing doorbells have four terminals, some had three, I had four. The package come with two rather easy wire clamps, simply lift the orange levers, insert the appropriate wires after removing them from the doorbell, insert the first two into the clamps and close the orange clamp, this connects them together (only do one clamp set at a time). Each wire inserted into the clamp, Ring has another new wire to replace it into the Doorbell's terminal). Once both are done. they already have a small phone jack looking clip on the end, place this into the Power Module (it comes with double sided tape), fit everything back into the doorbell, making sure the wires or clamps are not in the way of the doorbell chime on each side, and replace the cover. Remove the old doorbell button, slightly pulling wiring out gently with it before removing the wiring to give you enough wire to connect to the two terminals on the Ring Doorbell, if there is too much, it can be pushed back into the hole it comes out of. Ring also includes a template should new holes need to be drilled, it also comes with molly's to insert into the drilled holes. (If by chance you have any type of aluminum or plastic layered siding, you may not need the molly's)<br><br>First things first, go outside to your existing doorbell, or where you want to install, and check your Router signal is above average, if not you may need a router extender, I used a Netgear 1900ac range extender in the entryway, which I had to connect to the router, the setup must be made while plugged into the wall where your router is, this ensures an uninterrupted video and the ability to talk to whom ever is at the door. Make sure to turn the breaker back on if it was turned off, small DC voltage will not shock or harm you. you will need the drill bit which comes with the kit (if you have a drill, the orange screw driver, and your prefer Doorbell cover of the found in the box. Be careful opening the package with the screws, there is one very, very small one, this is the one which will screw into your Ring faceplate to keep it from being pulled off, or falling. Once the doorbell is connected, a ring around the button on the Ring Doorbell should be a white light spinning, just allow it to continue spinning until everything is wired and fastened to the wall, but do not put the cover on just yet. Open the ""Ring"" App on your phone, there is a small button on the right side of the doorbell to connect it to your homes WiFi (usually from your Router, your carrier's signal will not connect to the Ring Doorbell). The App on your phone will help you finish the setup. I have the Ring App installed on my laptop, and my Desktop PC's. If my 84 year old Pop can do this install, anyone should be able to do so. It also has an adjustable sensor to detect someone before they get to the door, another reason to have the Ring Chime, it alerts you from any room to hear the motion sensor without having to rely on your cell phone or tablet. I caught someone attempting to steal a UPS package, and could clearly see the person, I press on the talk button and told her to put it back, she is on video, she did put it back, and ran away to a waiting car.

2.0 out of 5 stars,One of the worst installation experiences with something as simple as a doorbell,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2018","<span>
  One of the worst installation experiences with something as simple as a doorbell.  First when I installed the doorbell it showed a WiFi network that I was to connect to but the connection failed.  After that I never ever saw the Ring SSID to connect to after multiple reboots.  I was told that the issue is that I have an older doorbell transformer that only goes up to 10VA and I needed one that went up to 20VA.<br><br>Also, while installing the doorbell my chime constantly rang.  I was told that my current chime was incompatible with the Ring Pro.  When I protested that I had not bargained for a new chime, since I liked my current one, I was told they would mail me a chime.  I was also told that they would send me a Pro Power Cable and I was not to use the Pro Power Kit with the new transformer.<br><br>Replacing the transformer was another hassle since the circuit breaker for it was not marked.  I had to get an electrician to help locate that since I did not want to work with a live wire.  Fortunately, a close friend and in-law is an electrician, and he helped identify the circuit breaker for the transformer.<br><br>Installed the transformer, the power cable, and the doorbell and it did not work.  Checked the voltage at the doorbell and found that I had no voltage.  Called support again and was told that they would mail me a number of Power Cables to try instead.  Again after a wait, the cables came in.  I installed the replacement cable and this time I had voltage at the doorbell.  So the original cable they sent me was bad.<br><br>Again I tried to install the doorbell but again no Ring WiFi SSD to connect to.  They asked me if the Pro was talking to me and I told them that since the very first time when it talked to me, it had not talked to me at any time I reset or installed it.  It was determined that the Ring Pro was bad.  But they seemed to be a bit reluctant to send me a replacement, and wanted me to send pictures of the wiring.  This is when I lost it with the support person at the aggravation I had gone through and volunteered to just return the whole unit.  Finally they sent me a replacement Pro.<br><br>This time, after a month of back and forth, multiple part replacements, and long times on support calls, finally the doorbell worked.  Support was generally immediate (no waiting time), quick, and mostly good, except for this time when they wanted pictures of wirings (and what would a picture of wires tell them?)<br><br>However, when it did work, once I rang the bell, we had some issues connecting to the doorbell for a live view.  Apparently it requires some time to go back to a mode where it is accessible, since it waits for no motion before doing so.  The time it takes to do this cannot be set.  So, it is rather annoying that you cannot get a live view whenever you want, but when the doorbell is ready for you to do so.  This time can vary.<br><br>I was out of town and when I got a notification that someone was at the door I clicked on the notification.  By the time the app came up and showed me the live view, the person had already left.  At another time, the live view just showed an arrow going constantly around to load the live view, but never did show me the live view. I just gave up, since by now the person at the door would have left.  Perhaps my wife was accessing the live view at the same time.  It seems that it does not allow more than one viewer, though I have not verified that.  But it is certainly very finicky to connect to, and the time it takes for the app to connect and load the live view is just too long to bother with.<br><br>The chime is just not loud enough compared to my previous chime and I cannot hear it in the whole (4600 sq ft) house as I could the old chime.  Also, while it does seem to have a number of chime options, for a sustained loud chime, there are hardly enough choices - just one, Dreidel Dreidel, which is a Jewish Hanukkah tune.  My older digital chime was a lot better with multiple loud and sustained chimes.<br><br>Finally, you should check out where your current doorbell is installed.  Is it facing the front or is it on a side wall?  Our doorbell was on the side brick wall.  To rewire it would be hard and expensive.  So, we only get a side view and not a front view of the person ringing the doorbell.  Also, the level of the doorbell is not ideal for a video.  If this unit is being installed in a new house it may be okay.  But if it is replacing an existing doorbell, there are a number of issues, including the video angle and view.<br><br>At this point we are still using the Ring Pro Doorbell and chime.  But I am not all that thrilled with it.

  Ring is a First Class Company. When I moved from my prior house, I failed to remove and bring with me the Pro Power Kit that connects to the actual internal doorbell. Thus, I have my Ring Doorbell Pro external doorbell unit but not the Pro Power Kit to connect inside the house doobell chime unit in the hallway. My internet search failed to locate any source for purchasing the power kit independent from purchasing the entire doorbell system. I tried Google, Amazon and Ring’s website. I called the 24/7 number that’s listed on their website, on a Sunday, got a live person and they are sending me a replacement free of charge. I wanted to pay for it but they refused to take payment for the replacement part. It was my fault, but they covered the cost completely. I was happy with the product before but now I am elated!  Thank you Ring, I’ll be purchasing some of your motion activated spotlight video units now that I see what kind of service that I can expect.<br><br>R. K. Garrett<br>Milton, FL

  We have been pleased with the overall performance of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro with HD Video. My husband found it pretty easy to install into our existing doorbell wiring. The camera shoots good quality video. It records sound pretty well most of the time. The main complaint we have had is that the audio quality is sometimes choppy. It misses out a little bit. We could blame some of that on our wifi signal, but we don't have problems with other devices in this area. The sensitivity of the motion sensor is adjustable which is helpful. We have a rural home with a driveway that comes up to the garage on the side of our home. There is a patio with a side entrance which is where most delivery drivers leave packages. This can be a problem in the summer time when packages are left in the baking sun. My husband works from home so it's helpful to know when a package has been delivered. We wanted enough sensitivity to capture when a vehicle comes in the driveway and/or leaves so that we get notified when someone is there. Because the sidewalk next to the patio runs to our front door, my husband moved the doorbell camera out from the door frame onto the the brick exterior. This gives a good panoramic view of our driveway and the sidewalk to the front door so we are basically covering two doors with one camera. Because the infrared motion sensor picks up heat, we have noticed that if my husband walks down the driveway on a hot summer day, it won't detect his presence. We also like the feature allowing us to turn the motion sensor off at night because we found that with the level of sensitivity we use, the movement of insects can set it off in the dark. We both have the app on our cell phones so we get notifications. You can answer the door real time and speak with someone who is there, but we haven't really had a need to do that. Overall, we are pleased with the purchase.

  We like the Ring doorbell overall, but the app needs work.  My wife and I each have the app on our iPhones.  When there is a ring or motion, we get an alert on our phones.  Problem is, nearly all of the time we can't actually see the video until long after the event is over.  We can pull up the app, but get no video feed until after we've answered the door, recording has finished and the archive of the video is available.  Oddly enough, the app seemed to work a lot better before the last few ""upgrades"".  When we first started using the Ring doorbell, I could pretty always see live video when there was a motion event or a doorbell ring.  Now I can't, which greatly reduces the usefulness of this ridiculously expensive doorbell.<br><br>I was quite annoyed when the ""neighborhood"" thing was added to the app, and notifications for that were turned on without asking.  I started getting flooded with alerts whenever someone within a couple of miles posted video from their doorbell.  I really do not care when door to door salesmen show up at a house two miles away from me.  I'd much rather have an app that WORKS, not another useless ""social networking"" attempt.<br><br>I would rate this four or five stars if the app worked as it should -- as it did once -- as advertised.  As it is, I don't know that I would recommend it unless things improve.

  I've had the door bell pro for about three years, and loved it so much I replaced all my floodlights with their floodlight cams. The button on my ring started working only intermittently here a few months ago, and Ring sent me a replacement no problem.<br><br>The motion zones and settings are invaluable and take a while to get dialed in so your phone doesn't go off every time a car drives by or a cat crosses your lawn. I even had to set a zone so it wouldn't alert me when I walked past my front door as some light bounces off the wall.<br><br>The only thing I will say bad, is it is VERY dependent on the quality of your Wi-Fi network. My old house was smaller and I had no problems, but this new house was bigger and I was having connection problems on all of my cameras. Support will tell you that you need 5Mb/s down and 1 up to use their cameras, and will be quick to blame your connection on any issues. Their method of testing will be to do a speed test on your phone while next to the camera. Problem is your phone must have a better antenna than the ring, because I was getting 45ish up and 6 down and still having trouble. They blamed by internet, Wi-Fi and even sent me some free Wi-Fi repeaters and it didn't really help. ALL my problems stopped when I ditched Comcast's built in Wi-Fi for a 250 dollar gaming router from Netgear. The router even let me set the Ring devices as a priority in the event of high network traffic. Also if you are having problems with your mechanical chime, a new transformer might be in order, as this device needs a solid 16 volts to both power it and ring your doorbell. A healthy transformer will actually be putting out closer to 18v.<br><br>All in all I love this doorbell.. Me and my wife were in Europe a few years back and we were telling door to door salesmen we were home but couldn't come to the door. It was also nifty when we had our house on the market as we could hear what the agents and prospective buyers were saying when they stepped outside lol!

  I set up my Ring Pro and other than my breaker box being horribly mislabeled, install was a breeze. My doorbell has direct power so all I had to do was install the extra voltage supply on my bell, and then hook up the ringer / camera itself.<br><br>Unfortunately, that's where the easy part ended.<br><br>For those thinking about grabbing a Ring, I highly suggest you take a look at where your current ringer is located. My home was built by the lowest bidder so they installed the ringer directly on the door frame. The door frame is sunken in, and there's a brick facia that comes out from the door. So when I installed the ringer, it was directly on the door frame, but there was 2-3 inches of brick which directly blocked the entire right side of the camera. So basically, my 180 degree view was cropped into a 90 degree view.<br><br>This might not have been so bad, except that the Ring Pro's night vision camera is pretty horrible. The light from the door bell button was bright enough that it reflected off of the brick at night and totally washed out the infrared, since it saw the reflection of the bell ring as a giant light source. This made it so my door frame was nicely lit up, but everything else was pitch black.<br><br>I basically had to MacGyver a solution where I currently have a pretty unsightly 3"" wooden block screwed into my doorframe, and the bell sits on top of that. However, other than completely re-wiring my doorbell to come out of the brick, there's no other workaround for me at this time.<br><br>So in short, take a good look at where you'll be installing the ringer.

  It was my first time doing anything electrical as I ALWAYS call the electrician. I carefully followed the instructions and It was easy to install. I love that you can adjust the motion sensor areas. The video is super clear and the audio is good most of the time. There is a response time lag. From the time the door bell is rung to the time the chime rings inside the home, there is a lag but that is not a big deal to me. Since I installed it, I have noticed less solicitors come to the door. Ha! There is a monthly charge of $3 to store video but I am still on the free 30 day trial. I would recommend this product to anyone. I understand that it is a bit pricey however I personally feel safer and that is priceless.

When you first power on the existing Nutone chime might ring three times until everything gets powered up.

  To start, I would have given this a 5 star rating, instead of a 4 only because I have found that the instructions to be really vague (as to what you need to do in certain situations when replacing an existing doorbell) and quality control (in how the product is handled from being packed to me opening the box up at home seems to have an issue. I wanted this Pro version to replace my standard doorbells for both my front and back doors. Within the last three months, I have bought 5 in total.  The first two I purchased (from a big box store didn't work).  I replaced the transformer (per the instructions) and those two would not activate.  So, I returned them (and swore I would never buy this product again!).  After a week of wondering what the heck went wrong with that whole scenario, I re-read everything and went online searching for answers as to why this product wasn't working form me (even though there were a ton of positive reviews).  It turns out (if I had read the instructions a little better) that if you have a dual (all in one) dual (front and back door) doorbell system (mine was a Hampton Bay product) this isn't going to work.  So, I bought another, separate doorbell system for the backdoor (separate transformer and bell box), ordered two more Ring Pro Doorbells through Amazon this time and connected everything.  There was hope!  The front doorbell worked like a charm!  I was excited!  However, the backdoor bell didn't work after connecting the Pro into the system.  I verified that the second Pro unit was defective by connecting it to the front door system and it still did not power up.  Fortunately, I requested an exchange through Amazon and within two days, I had a new replacement.  I took the button and transmitter out of the box, and within 4 minutes...BAM!!! the rear doorbell was online and working flawlessly!  These doorbell systems are awesome!  Remember, if you don't want your doorbell sensor to pick up movement of cars from the street (the street is 150 feet away!), make sure the change the motion sensor setting to people only.  The system design gets 5 Stars, the quality control and instructions need improvement.

  Installation was easy, but it took several hours for the doorbell to find my network.  No issues since (2 weeks).  There's quite a bit of a delay (15 seconds) between the time someone rings the doorbell and you can answer it via the app, unless you just so happen to already have the app open (even then there's a delay).  There's also a delay for audio -- you can't have a normal sounding conversation like the commercials imply.  The delay I'm seeing is around 3 seconds (which is a lot longer than it sounds).<br>The app has a lot of little issues -- the most glaring is that it only works in portrait mode. (Except when it's playing a video, or live video -- those work in landscape).<br>You can set the app to open up full screen video automatically when someone rings the door bell -- but only if you have the app open when they ring it (I'm using an old android table for this, so the app is always open on it.)  Otherwise you just get a notification.  It says you can do the same if it detects motion (i.e., if someone drops off a package but doesn't ring the doorbell), but this does not work.  You only get a notification.  Apparently it used to work in earlier versions of the app.<br>The hardware is good, but the app really needs some work. Hopefully it will improved upon over the next few months.

The ability to interact with someone at the door from inside the home or many miles away without them knowing is just awesome. The ability to see who is at your door without having to look through a window or the peephole is just awesome. This doorbell in my case, is highly reliable.

  We have 2 Nest Thermostats. They work just fine. But, guess what, the Nest Doorbell -RING PRO- in the same gave us trouble, here's why, and what we did to fix it.<br><br>First- Minimum requirements to function correctly: 1) 16-24vac transformer with STEADY output, 2) Clean wiring setup without extraneous items pulling (or shorting) out the juice, 3) important to have 3900ma ""push"" in the voltage (most 16vac transformers only put out 1000ma which is not nearly enough juice). The first 2 items are a no brainer for any good home DIY guy, it's the 3rd one that gets by you and causes the problems when you overlook it.<br><br>You see most 16vac transformers, used in most homes today, produce adequate voltage, but not adequate AMPS. A 24vac transformer overcharges voltage in the circuit for your other devices by 50% (thermostats, doorbells, etc.) but they will probably be fine if you switch to a 24vac transformer. The voltage is there, just not enough amps 'pushing' to run the Ring PRO reliably. Took me about 2 weeks to figure this out. Life would have been much easier had Ring found a camera that would run reliably on 1000ma instead of their 3900ma camera.<br><br>So, long story short, here is what I did to get my Ring Pro up and running reliably.<br><br>1- Replaced my 16vac, 1000ma transformer with a 24vac, 4000ma, standard transformer.<br>2- Installed a powerful wifi repeater to boost the signal substantially.<br>3- Removed a rear doorbell wire, that upon inspection had ""leakage"" and was pulling down the circuit.<br>4- Inspected all wiring, and checked both vac and ma at the doorbell connection by the front door.<br>5- Returned one Ring Pro and purchased another which seemed to have a much better wifi reception than the original unit.<br><br>Presto. Works great. Hope this helps you out too. Nest/Ring specialists are pretty much clueless about anything technical like this. All they could do was read through steps to check, and they were NEVER any real help to me. Had to figure this out on my own.<br><br>One comment. Why does Ring not provide a complete ""hard reset/restart"" via your phone or pad wherever you are in case of difficulty? This is simply an example of how little diligence they put into the product design and software. It's like all the adults left the room when they designed this thing and wrote the instruction manual.<br><br>Perhaps the next version will correct all this, in the meantime the data contained herein should get you up and running reliably.

   Someone tried twice during the middle of the night last week to break down our front door, which was the reason why we decided to get some sort of security device.  We bought this Doorbell Pro with much trepidation, having read reviews of folks who had difficulties with getting it up and running.  I was lucky:  my regular doorbell transformer was kicking out the needed voltage (24VAC), and my WiFi was strong enough to get a good signal to the Pro without needing to add an extender or upgrade the router.  The installation kit was thorough and instructions were very good.  I like that it comes with a variety of install screws and wire extenders (which I needed for my own installation), and 4 different cover plates.  My wife helped with the installation by telling me which cover I like.  :-)  The recorded images are more than adequate for seeing what/who is outside the front door, and downloading the ""event histories"" is easily accomplished.  Even before we had had a chance to experiment with the talk/speaker system, I had a chance to use that feature:  I was around the corner walking our dog when I received a doorbell alert.  Though I fumbled to open up the app and find how to handle it, the post office employee was still there, trying to deliver some registered mail.  I told her where I was and that I'd be there in a minute.  I quickly returned to sign the paperwork.  A final quick story:  a skunk has recently been terrorizing our neighborhood.  We got a motion alert last night at 9:13 pm, so we looked out the front windows.  Didn't see anything, but I went back to the ""event history"" and saw that the skunk had walked up our front walk.  It later came back after midnight, which I was albe to see the next morning when checking overnight activity outside.  We also like the ""Live View"" option.  One caution: there is a slight delay (3-4 sec.?) in the thing working and then communicating with your smart device.  So be expecting that.  One final positive:  I've called their customer service several times with operational questions, and got thru each time almost immediately to a helpful, English-speaking rep. All in all, we're very happy with this device and with the Ring company.  I hope your experience is also this positive.

  We've had The Ring for 2 years. It's not great, not terrible It sometimes does not connect and we don't here the door bell. Also, it only sees people when close up. So, if you are hoping for street side/side walk images, they are blurry. If you need to access the cloud to see a certain time and day, you have to scroll thru ALL activity prior. The app was designed poorly.  I would say DON'T buy the stick up version, too easily stolen.  It's better then nothing, I guess. But, I would have purchased a different brand and item had I known.

  Bought this doorbell since we were heading out on vacation. Setup the item as instructed and every 4 to 6 hours the device would go OFFLINE. Had to go to the breaker box and turn the power off, remove all the screws from the doorbell and wiring cables. Once that was done, I had to wire and screw it all back together and turn the breaker power back on. Then the unit would work again for 4 to 6 hours. Called tech support and they said my setting was set too high and I needed to lower it to say people only. We that did not work either. They even sent me a special cable to keep the power regulated better, but nope, that did not work. Returned unit.

  To make the Ring Doorbell Pro function as a security camera please let us enable/disable motion alerts for separate zones.<br><br>For example, record on motion for every zone. Alert me only if someone is at the zone covering the door. Don’t alert me if someone is on the grass, but do record it.<br><br>Please provide thumbnails next to each event. Lorex/Flir cameras provide this functionality and it is great!

After about 6 months, I struggled with the voltage to the door chime when it rained. The product still notified when there was movement or if the doorbell rang, but the chime inside the house (wired version) was flaky. It could be the wiring in the wall (nothing to do with Ring or the doorbell). That said, the customer service was amazing. Because the problem was intermittent, it took a few calls, but they were tremendously helpful in making sure we were happy with the product.<br>Thanks Ring! love your company.

  I gave the Ring Video Pro two stars because the hardwiring was very easy and the directions were clear and concise, and because my one and only contact with Caleb (Ring support personnel), exceeded my exceptions 1000 fold.  Then everything went south.  Completing installation was a nightmare.  I tried so many times to connect my phone and doorbell but it always failed.  What should have been really simple was making me nuts and very disappointed.  It's wasn't a wi-fi issue as the doorbell would connect to it.  I called Ring and after an exhausting 50 minutes on the phone with them, it was suggested that I give my cable company Spectrum a call since my issue was the doorbell could not complete the installation and it was presumed to be a modem issue.  Caleb was very knowledgeable about modems, mine in particular, and he offered if my cable company couldn't fix the problem to contact him again via email and he would help out.  All of this took place Friday evening.<br><br>Saturday, early evening, I spoke to Spectrum and the phone tech was terrific as he was able to reconfigure my modem to get my doorbell and video up an running.  He spent a lot of time with me and I'm grateful for the effort he put forward.  Very happy, we hung up and I started to play around with the doorbell and app to learn it's features and how to make it work.  I noticed that the motion sensor wasn't working, even after adjusting the sensitivity setting.  I called my neighbor over to show her the doorbell because she was interested in perhaps getting one as well.  My phone never alerted me that she was approaching by sensing movement, but it did work well when she rang the doorbell.  Even waving my hand in front of the doorbell didn't activate it.  My neighbor left.<br><br>My neighbor came back over unannounced and rang the doorbell around 9:00 pm to see how it would work in the dark.  It appeared to work well and the picture was really good too.  We played with the voice features and we could hear each other well.  No issues with the voice controls. Still no motion detection.  She left.<br><br>Around 10:00 pm I wanted to look at the ""live"" picture from my phone and nothing.  I looked at my doorbell and it was no longer lit up and so I checked the settings and it said ""offline"" and ""voltage too low.""  Really?  Since when, it was working an hour ago.  But it never worked since.  I emailed them on Sunday and asked for Caleb to call me when he gets the email.  But I didn't hear back and that's fine, maybe he doesn't work on Sunday.  On Monday I emailed Caleb again and never heard back from him. I sent them a third email on Monday asking anyone to get back with me or I'll be forced to return the doorbell.<br><br>Well, it's going back today.  No one from Ring called me or emailed me back.  Horrible.  I guess they have so much business they don't need mine (or my neighbors).  I'm very disappointed at how this went downhill so quickly and with no regard or concern for me, the consumer.

  UPDATE 8/24/18:<br><br>Ring came through after the negative review.  I spoke w/ Ashlei O. at length, who sent me a new Ring Pro.  She was great.  Now I have perfect voltage and connectivity.  There are also no heat problems noted, as the device appears to be re-designed with a plastic ""heat-sink"" on the back side.<br><br>*************************************************************************<br><br>After having the Ring Pro for about a year and a half where it worked flawlessly, it died unexpectedly after an update.  In fact, it became unresponsive after a bell ring, after which the door chime ""plunger"" got stuck in ""on"" position and melted.  So, after calling Ring, they sent me a new doorbell and in the meantime, I replaced a newer transformer with the same (NuTone C915, 16 V, 10 VA) and the chime box (Heath-Zenith WD-1, Ring compatible).<br><br>I then installed the new (probably refurbished) Ring Pro and the chime box would not ring and WiFi connectivity was always poor to average at best.  After multiple calls/emails, sending in photos, etc., I was told to replace the transformer with a 16 V, 30 VA, even though I had great power to the doorbell (&gt;65,000 mV).  Again, I followed Ring's advice and put in the new transformer, only to have the chime work intermittently.  I then see that the chime box is only rated for up to 10 VA.  Rather than have another meltdown with a semi-functional chime, I re-installed the 10 VA.<br><br>Now, after all this, the doorbell is only getting 3000mV (poor voltage), the bell works occasionally and the WiFi is still not great.  Ring now admits that they should have never advised me to change the transformer, but they don't think that's the issue.  Instead, they believe the unit is running hot (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, ambient temperature of about 85 today) and this is what's causing the problem.  But, they have no solution to this ""known problem"" and have not offered to replace/refund the cost of the doorbell.  I'm at a loss.  Maybe I'll try the Nest, but I certainly wouldn't advise anyone to purchase this product based on my experience.

  Review update 1/15/2018<br>I've been using the Ring Pro now for 10 months, and have some mixed feelings about it. When I'm at work, and someone rings my doorbell I get a notification, but the video refuses to load - I get that spinning cursor and nothing else. I thought that the concrete block walls were blocking the wifi signal, so I placed a mesh wifi node in the window, right above the Ring, but that hasn't helped.<br><br>Recently, the doorbell stopped ringing, and the app ceased notifying me when someone pressed my doorbell. I found that the button you press was cracked down the center. I don't know that I can fault the doorbell - I've got video of the UPS delivery guys running up to my front door, throwing my package down, and slamming the doorbell with the heel of their hand. Think any doorbell stands a chance of breaking the way some of these delivery guys hit the bell. Anyway, I just got off the phone with Ring support, and I have to say the support technician just handed me one of the best customer service experiences I've had. Since the ring is still in warranty he immediately ordered up a replacement. While he was placing the order he filled me in on how Amazon just acquired Ring, and the line of products they now offer that will support and enhance the video doorbell. Got to admit, he got me interested, all right. I've been looking at the Ring Neighborhood part of the app, and I'm seeing (to my surprise) how much crime is going on close to my home. I'm really interested in beefing up my home security, so the Ring line of products sound appealing.<br><br>I still like the Ring Pro; it functions far better than the previous video doorbell I had (an August product).<br>=====================<br>I purchased Ring Pro to replace an existing August video doorbell. The August had terrible wifi connectivity problems, and after listening to coworkers who'd installed a Ring unit, I decided to give Ring a try.<br><br>First Impressions out of the box were good. The unit looks very nice, and included a lot of documentation for each step in the installation. I couldn't help but notice, though, there were 4 additional face plates in various colors. Really? I'm not pleased at having to pay for additional faceplates when 4 of them will be trash. The Ring unit itself is smaller than I'd pictured. It's tall, but quite slim. Good thing Ring included a backer plate in the box.<br><br>Installing the door chime unit - this process was simple enough - Ring gives you pretty clear step-by-step visual instructions, but the connectors they included were HUGE, and I had to struggle to fit them inside the chime casing without interfering with the mechanical chimes. It probably wouldn't be an issue inside an electronic doorbell, but a mechanical chime present a real space problem.<br><br>Installing the doorbell - My doorbell is surface mounted on a concrete block and stucco (CBS) surface. The previous August unit was able to use the existing mounting holes from the original doorbell, but the Ring unit is much longer, so I had to drill new holes. The backer plate had handy 'stand-off' pegs on the back that I could break off if needed, so it fit the irregular stucco surface quite well. Once again, the Ring-supplied wire connectors were huge, and couldn't be used. Luckily, I had some crimp connectors that could be used in the very tight space. There are some VERY small screws at this point in the installation, so use a lot of caution - if you drop one, that could easily be the last time you'll ever see that screw. Fortunately, Ring included some extra screws. I was fortunate in that I didn't lose any. The installation - once I brought in the connectors that worked - was pretty easy, and once the power was back on I almost immediately got the pairing prompts from the doorbell.<br><br>Pairing - almost ridiculously easy. The app and doorbell found each other immediately, and setup was quick.<br><br>Post-install issues - right off, I noticed that I couldn't see the face of anyone standing at my door after they rang the doorbell. My location is just to the right of my front door, so the field of view is great for anyone approaching my door, but once they got close enough to ring the bell I could no longer see their face. I had to purchase angle plate adaptors for the unit so I could see those faces. Once installed, I was able to clearly see faces standing at my door and that issue was resolved. It really irritates me that I had to spend additional money for these. Bad as it was, the August unit included the angle plates when you purchased the doorbell. With Ring, I had to purchase the angle plate kit separately from another vendor, which includes two plates to handle a wide range of view angles.  Why can't Ring put in an angle plate adaptor instead of 4 extra faceplates? I know I can't be the only one with a doorbell mounted six inches to the right of my front door.<br><br>Poor app performance for remotely answering the doorbell - when using the app at work to answer the door, it takes a VERY LONG TIME for the video to begin. I have real-time audio, but the video never kicks in for at least two minutes. I have a pretty good signal at the door - the app reports a ""GOOD -38"" signal, and at work I have a very strong wifi and cellular connection, so not sure why this is happening. I have a window directly over the door, and a wifi mesh network point sits in that window, so there's plenty of signal strength at the doorbell. The poor app performance for real time viewing is the single biggest con I have with the Ring Pro.<br><br>Overall, I like this unit. It is much superior to the August video doorbell it replaced in nearly every functional aspect. I'm less fond of the fact that there are 4 extra faceplates in the box, no angle plates, and the wire connectors provided are WAY too large for the spaces they're intended to fit in. The app performance could be better. That having been said, though, I really like the ""Neighborhood"" feature, where Ring owners can share videos of worrisome visitors, and Ring owners nearby can see them and can react/comment on them.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Just Door Bell but Ring System Critique in Detail.,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2017","<span>
  I ran into several problems just trying to get this thing to work in the first place.  My doorbell transformer was quite old and did not put out enough juice to even power this thing.  I had 12 VAC and the Ring door bell requires 24 VAC.  In many older homes the doorbell transformer is put in obscure places and often are hard to find.  My home was no exception.  I gave it my best shot but in the end had to hire an electrician to find and replace it for me.  Once that problem was solved, during setup it had trouble finding my AT@T provided router.  I called AT@T and they replaced my router and that helped with the doorbell setup but did not help with my stickup cam setup that is located outside on the back side of my house.  There still was not enough output from my router so I bought the Chime Pro WiFi Extender but it did not really provide any signal strength boost to help with my stick up cam issue.  The doorbell itself kept losing the WiFi signal but not as often as the stick up cam.  The problem is that to get the doorbell working again I have to take the cover off the doorbell every single time I have a signal loss to be able to reset it.  I pray every time I do not drop the tiny little screw that is used to hold it on.  As far as the stickup cam, I have to haul out a ladder and climb up in the air to reset it when it loses its signal.  You can partly blame these issues on the router as the standard router only puts out about 50 mwatts of power (not sure what my AT@T router puts out but it probably is not much better than 50 mwatts) but still you would think that they would build these Ring parts to have a better sensitivity than they do.  Every device inside and outside my house that connects to my router has enough sensitivity to have no connectivity issues anywhere on my property. This is a review about the doorbell but you cannot do a review justice without talking about the doorbell system.  The Chime Pro, as I stated previously is more like a repeater and is not a range extender even though they call it that.  When you do a Ring installation, the first step is to add the Ring app to you smart phone. You start with the doorbell setup.  One of the first steps is to attach to the ring network that shows up on your smart phone in the list of WiFi devices.  After that part of the setup is done you are then given that opportunity to add the Ring network to you normal router network.  This step is necessary so you can have Ring log your motion video triggers on their web site and that is what you pay the monthly fee for.  Usually, the next step in the setup is to add the Chime Pro Extender.  I have an issue with the fact that the reset button to get the setup started requires a very tiny paper clip or something on that order to even get to the reset button through a hole on the right side of the unit.  A large paper clip will not work because it is too big.  Then you are supposed to look for the ring logo on the front of the unit to be flashing in a light blue color but unless you are working in the dark you will not be able to see the flashing and then if you are working in the dark you will not be able to see the small reset hole in the side of the unit.  If you are lucky enough to have gotten this far in the setup, the Chime Pro setup will ask you to identify and attach to the Chime Pro network in the list of Wi Fi devices that your phone is able to see. Once attached you will once again be presented with a list of WiFi devices in your area where you are expected to select your normal router network.  This more or less finishes the Chime Pro extender setup other than selecting your ring tone and motion sensor tone from a list of possibles.  To me, this is the only real use and one of the nicest features for the Chime Pro Extender because it certainly does not extend the range.  The final step for me and for anybody else that bought a stick up camera is to add it to the Ring network after installation.  As I stated, I have to get out a ladder when setup becomes necessary so I can hit the reset button to start the setup procedure.  Here lies yet another issue.  The setup button on the back of of the unit causes a small LED (also on the back of the unit) to start flashing.  Once again, this is an LED that is nearly impossible to see.  Because you have already setup your Chime Pro Extender at this point, your stick up cam will join the same network as it and that will allow any motion triggers to be logged by Ring and it will allow the stick up cam to also use the Chime Pro motion alert alarm that the door bell uses.  You do not have to attach the stick up cam to the Chime Pro network (in case you did not purchase it or find it to be virtually useless) but if you do not, you will not get motion alerts and you motion alerts will not be logged with Ring.  So this lists all the problems I have run into and some of the suggestions for improvement should be self-evident but to be clear, here is where I think they could improve their product.  First the doorbell.  It would be nice if they could make it work with either a 12 or 24 VAC source but the worst part is the location of the reset button.  A software reset would be really nice but in lieu of that, it would be great if you did not have to remove the retaining faceplate container to be able to reach the reset button.  This is where a small hole that you could use a paper clip to reset would be nice so you would not have to remove the faceplate.  Also, the reset should be on either the top or bottom of the unit (and unlike the Chime Pro Extender, depress enough so that you know you really did make a connection with the button inside the hole).  On my installation, the only way I could mount it resulted in the reset button sitting right up next to a brick wall with only about an inch or less between the bricks and the reset button.  For the Chime Pro Extender, they could first off make it so it was a true extender that would extend the range of your router since the sensitivity of the Ring Door bell and Stick Up Cam are both so lacking.  At best, it is only a repeater.  Secondly, they could use an LED on the front of the thing that you could actually see when it flashed and third, they could put a bigger hole on the side of the unit or use no hole at all but instead just use a button.  I do not have a large gripe against the stickup cam other than it could stand to have a little higher sensitivity.  I got around all these issues pretty much after the fact by buying a Amped Wireless High Power AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender.  It puts out 600 mwatts of power and has a range of 10,000 sq. ft.  It costs roughly the same as the Chime Pro Extender but the difference is that it is a true range extender.  I have only had this for a short time so I don't know if all my Ring issues are now resolved but I did find out that my Internet speed test is only about half of what it is without the range extender.  As a result, I am now looking at purchasing a new router that is much better than the one provided by AT&amp;T.  It is also supplied by Amped Wireless and has a range of 10,000 ft as well.  I should then no longer need the range extender but I do have need of a repeater with Ethernet ports to use at a location remote to my router so I will probably just use the extender as a repeater to take over that functionality.

  I decided to try to install the Ring Video Doorbell Pro myself.  After reading the instructions &amp; watching the videos it didn't sound difficult; however I have an old house and didn't know how good or powerful the wiring was for my current doorbell, which wasn't that stable.  I had no problem installing the Ring on the outside less the outside cover, and also had no problem following the directions installing it on the inside, however I could never start up the video part.  My system also said my Ring wasn't getting enough power.  I contacted the customer service technical area and they called me back relatively quick.  The gentleman asked for a couple photos of both the exterior of how my Ring looked and of the interior installation.  He asked several questions, then he walked me through step by step of everything I was to do, waited for both me to complete the steps and also for the system to reboot  and start up.  He was not impatient nor did he make me feel like I didn't know what I was doing even in some steps I didn't.  When all was said and done, my system worked great, the video worked great just as it was supposed to.

  I was very excited to get this product, installation went pretty smoothly except the app showed it had low voltage even after I verified with a VOM at 18v I called their customer service and they were very helpful. They told me there is a capacitor inside the doorbell that needed to charge prior to showing good on voltage.  Ring should have had this in their online troubleshooting to avoid a call to them. Seems fine now.<br><br>The reason I gave 2 stars was I was disappointed in the response time from when the motion picks someone up until you..view alert, attempt to watch alert, unlock iphone, then the app opens to watch live. I'm sure Apple is partly to blame.  Most of the time I feel like I'm fumbling around with the phone app longer than I should be.  I get intermittent motion alerts.  It picks up car headlights and cars driving by even though I have the motion perimeter in the app nowhere near the street.  Night vision resolution is a joke unless I have my porch light on all night.  The brightness from the day glares the face quality until they are right at the door.....so much for catching package thieves,  they will be blurred and long gone before I can even get the app open. While I get woken up at night for false alarms.  The other day I tested the doorbell and it showed registering device I. The app for 15 minutes, days after I already did.  I thought about returning, but it's better than having nothing.

  Worked well for about 2 months then unable to open video in time to see who or what activated the notification before they were gone. Also, the chime for the actual doorbell stopped working and the alert on our phone was the only way to know when someone was at the door when we were home. After trying to find a remedy to the problem, I replaced the doorbell transformer and I couldn’t get the Ring doorbell to reconnect to our WiFi. I spent close to an hour on the phone with support going through the procedure several only to determine the product was no longer working and no under warranty and was a $200 waste of money.

I am currently on my 3rd replacement in less than 6 weeks.  The 1st one I purchased from Amazon arrive dead and needed to be replaced. The 2nd one worked for about 10 days and died. The 3rd one is working fine but the update on the app does not allow me to speak with the person at the door. I can no longer hear them nor can they hear me.<br><br>Unfortunately this update has affected all the phones and tablets So nothing works properly with ring.<br><br>I do not recommend this product.

  Connection is sketchy, if you can get it to connect, and that's even after getting $100 in ring pro wifi extenders. Worked well in the beginning but over time loses connection at random and usually when needed the most. Ability to select motion detection areas is a great feature though. Response is delayed so you get the video on your phone after the fact...<br><br>I had mine for 14 months and it stopped working all of a sudden. The button broke after about 9 months but kept working just long enough to pass the 12 month warranty. If you have that issue, don't be honest and report it broken and just report it stollen. They will NOT stand  behind the product after 12 months of purchase, but offer a $50 discount to purchase another one... yet they offer lifetime replacement if stollen... smh<br><br>So, that would be roughly $450 for spent in 14 months for a doorbell, yes it has a camera but sketchy hit or miss connection. Already spent $750 in other ring products and services, now they want me to pay another $200 to replace something that based on experience my only last 13-14 months...<br><br>Ring will not stand behind the product after 12 months of purchase, buttons should be designed to be pushed but break... went back to the 10 year old cheap simple button doorbell that still works and botton intake, still lights up also...

  We’ve had this doorbell for a little over 2 years.  We barely use it anymore because it takes so long to connect and show video after the doorbell is rung.  People are usually walking away by the time it starts to display the video.  When it does finally come up the ghosting of images makes it almost unusable.  And the audio is garbled to the point that communication is impossible.  The device health is good and we ran a speed test.  There is no reason it should not be working properly.  Even when it was new it wasn’t much better.<br><br>The other features are innovative and useful.  For example, displaying videos on a map keeps your community aware of what’s going on nearby.  The device health page is somewhat useful.  Being able to review videos later isn’t terribly impaired and can be helpful.<br><br>Overall, I do not recommend this product.  It’s a great idea but they need to make it better.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Some Pros and Cons,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2019","<span>
  This is a nice quick solution to combat porch pirates.  It is relatively easy to install if your existing doorbell is already in a good location for a camera.  Not so good if it's not.  I had to move it 18 inches higher for an optimal angle, which required some rerouting of the doorbell wires.  Not an easy or simple task.  It includes two optional angled base plates to help with camera angle.  It includes four different colored face plates to help match exterior.  I like that it includes the Ring Network, which keeps you up to date with crime involving other Ring users.  Our police department is now receiving Ring data.  My biggest complaint is that there must be an ""Event"" for the device to upload video to the Ring cloud.  An event is either a Live Stream Viewing (User uses the App to see live video) or a Motion Detect.  The motion detect setup is tricky.  After I first installed, with a level 2 sensitivity (ranges 1 to 5 with 5 the most sensitive) and one motion detect zone covering the center of the FOV and approximately 50% of the entire FOV, I was getting a positive motion detect with every large vehicle passing the front of my house.  I manually redrew and added motion detect zones to eliminate the street while maintaining my porch and walkway.  Although there is a capability of creating multiple motion detect zones, there is only one global sensitivity setting.  My complaint is that this should be configurable on a zone by zone basis.

  I've worked in camera and security technology for over 30 years. For the cost of the Ring Pro Doorbell, I figured there would be a ""catch"" to it, i.e. poor quality picture, difficult to install, dropping wi-fi signal, etc. To my surprise, the unit is very easy to install. The package contains multiple ""backing"" to assist when you are installing your unit onto an uneven surface. The extra backings even stack together! For example, if you need to angle it AND slope it (due to siding slope), you simply stack (snap) the two backings together, attach it to the wall, and you're done! The doorbell then simply screws to the backings, install the desired face plate (of which there are several to chose from) and complete the simple Wi-Fi setup! It really is that easy! The unit has never dropped off the wi-fi and the picture is as clear as a bell (no pun intended). The night vision really extends out there and I was impressed on how far. I have several game cameras and I only wish those would reach as far as the Ring Doorbell Plus camera. notification and motion capture is instant with very little if any delay. Overall, a very impressive unit for the price. First time installation took me about 15 minutes. Great product.

  We are still getting used to our Ring doorbell and making adjustments.  It's very sensitive. Had a bee for couple of days that would buzz in front of the doorbell which caused the chime to indicate someone at the door.  Good product and would recommend to other buyers.  We did hire an electrician to install it because of our limitations we could not do the job.<br>UPDATE: Have to drop my stars down to a 4.  The first Ring seemed to work fine, then it died. After talking to a Ring customer service person and being walked through the testing process, they determined it indeed had died and they would send us another one (5 stars for that).  We received the different Ring a week later.  Installing the different Ring is SO frustrating.  At the outlet there was 24+ power, at the doorbell, only 6. We thought perhaps the electrician had not connected the wires well enough in the attic. Checking the plug-in noticed the transformer was tilted down so prongs were not making contact.  I think it is a manufacture faux pa!  The weight of the transformer causes the prongs out of the wall receptacle stopping the power to go to the doorbell.  A screw tabs on the transformer, to be screwed into the center of the receptacle might solve the problem.<br>I imagine the first Ring Doorbell we had installed ""quit working"" for the same reason. Soon as we put the last screw in and completed the installation, the Ring doorbell stopped getting power.  Tomorrow we call the electrician, another service call which is not cheap, to see what we can do to keep power going to the doorbell.

  (Updated 24 Jun 2020)<br>(Updated 10 Jan 2020)<br><br>I would like to walk back some of my concern in my original post of 2019. Although my report was accurate to my experience, I would modify my last statement and change my recommendation for the product.<br><br>Even with the stated concerns, I think the product is still worth while. I spoke directly with a ""knowledgeable"" Ring representative who shared some useful insights, which I detail below. (The representative contacted me, following up on my earlier dissatisfaction.) The technician took a lot of time going over general operations, thoroughly reviewed and troubleshot my setup. He found that my device was set up correctly* and couldn't seem to determine what exactly may have caused the missed videos. However, there was a sincere and competent effort on Ring's part to help, and I appreciated seeing this level and quality of product support...too rare these days.<br><br>Below, to the best of my recollection, are some useful tips the representative shared:<br>- Ensuring there are no overlapping motion zones, as these could cause disruption to the video recordings. (*There was a slight overlap between two of my three zones, and perhaps this may have been the culprit.)<br>- The more zones you have the higher the chances for recording issues.<br>- Some product reviews in Amazon, stating problems with recordings, are the result of systems that use batteries (not Ring Pro), which are set up in ""Battery Save Mode."" (My Ring Pro unit is hardwired, so that was not a cause in my case.)<br>- If using the People Only Mode for you motion settings, ensuring that the camera is set such that it will at least capture a person's shoulders and head, as this is a factor used as a discriminator.<br>- Limitations of older software, older hardware (phones, tablets, etc.) may result in inability to use some features (i.e., being able to zoom-in on videos posted by neighbors in order to get a better look at perpetrators). I have since disproven this, at least the ""zoom"" capability, as I have experienced this same limitation with current hardware/software as well. I can zoom my own videos but not those posted by others.<br>- Motion-triggered video recording take one minute to complete. The only way to immediately access video while recording completes is by selecting ""Live View"" mode or ""answering"" the alert, both of which take you to live view. Only after the video finishes recording can you go back and review the entire recorded video. It would be nice to improve on this if possible, as it could be time-critical to see what triggered the alert...perhaps a snapshot view of the triggering event while the video prepares? That way, you could see if it was a pet, package-delivery, or a porch-pirate...something nice to know if you are away at the time.<br>=========================================================================================<br>Original Posting: (follow up posting above)<br>Great concept, but poor execution.<br>Too many times it misses capturing video of motion at my door. There have been times where I have walked out of my house, and it captures the movement with no problem. However, upon walking back in, there is no notification nor video captured. I have checked the ""health"" of the system during these times; everything checks good. I have also had the sensitivity maxed out as well as have the motion zone covering the area completely.<br>Also, when I do get a notification, it takes too long to obtain the video so that I can see what triggered the alert.<br>I have tried calling for tech support, but they have offered no real solution....

  Good job overall.  I like the doorbell and the app is very handy.  Now that this software is stable they need some slightly more complex algorithms regarding the motion detection.<br>They allow for multiple motion detection zones but I can’t adjust the sensitivity or deactivate the motion per zone according to a schedule.  I don’t want the area watching my driveway to trigger an alert when I leave for work but I still want to know if someone is approaching my front door, so the device cannot be deactivated.<br>The four motion detection options are very limiting.  Either I make all the zones insensitive or I get a notice every minute (literally) when my wife cleans the storm door glass.<br>Integration with SmartThings: I get an intruder alert when my system is armed because I can’t differentiate between the Ring’s outdoor motion sensor and my SmartThings inside one.  Someone approaching my door should not trigger an intruder alert, they are outside.

  After giving up on the Doorbell Pro I wrote a review that expressed my disappointment with the  unit.  I received an email from Ring Customer Service stating that they wanted to ""make it right.""  I was skeptical but responded to the email and talked to a technical support person from Ring.  The problem I was having was caused by the algorithm used by the camera for motion detection.  I am a scientist and have used vision systems before so I assumed the algorithm was sophisticated enough to ignore light from the street that is at 90 degrees from the camera view.  Instead, headlights and tail lights triggered motion alerts at night even when the lights were outside the motion areas I had set up on the camera.  In addition, I was using motion alerts to turn on a floodlight for 3 minutes.  The result was that the light would come on  from a car then motion was was triggered again when the floodlight turned off 3 minutes later.  The light flashed on and off all night long.  Ring replaced the Doorbell Pro with a Doorbell 2 which uses passive IR for motion detection and it works without a problem.  They even reimbursed me the difference in cost of the two units.  In the end I'm happy.<br><br>Previous review:<br>I have tried very, very hard to like this product but in the end I'm very disappointed.  In order to eliminate false alarms I have to turn the sensitivity down to the point where it responds to absolutely nothing.  One option is to use motion zones but the zones don't seem to work at all.  Motion outside the zones trigger an alarm as easily as motion in the zones.  In addition, if I turn an outside light on it identifies that there is motion.  My intention was to use smartthings to turn an outside light when the doorbell sees motion.  The light turns on with motion (outside a zone many times) then when the light turns off after motion ceases a motion alarm triggers.  This means that the light flashes on and off all night.  This is unacceptable and no better than a low tech and inexpensive alternative.  This was a giant waste of money.

I couldn't find any write-ups on the web so I figured I would share a few pics of what I did and it worked.  I had to pull with decent force to bend the wire and pull it through the hole .

  I purchased the new bell and was initially impressed by the very detailed step by step illustrated instructions. I was also impressed that all items needed for install was included, hate nothing more than stopping and having to go to the hardware store for a part.<br>The install went quick and the initial connection to my router was pretty straight forward, but then this is where it came to a stop. To clarify my router is new and was bought with enough signal strength to reach my detached garage 100 feet away and it does with 4 to 5 bars. The door bell is about 9 feet away and showed good signal strength so it should have been a breeze. Going step by step in the app which was again very detailed and straight forward but it turned out not to be. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app 5 times before I could get the bell to hook up to my router which it finally did, (by this time I was on the phone with support which was friendly and seemed knowledgeable) this process took about 45 min and when it finally worked it lasted about 30 mins. Did the same process as above again and this time it lasted about 8 hours. Customer service thought that part of the issue was the bell needs a bit of time to power up as they started and once it did and downloaded new updates it should be fine, but it was not the case. I went through uninstall and reinstall again and it took for about 6 hours before disconnecting and would not reconnect by itself I had to remove and reinstall. I have an orbi router with a satellite and I'm not sure if the software with the bell is just not friendly with it or what but I finally removed it and returned it which as always with amazon went smoothly. I'm sure it is a good product but it did not work for us. Also to clarify we have 6 alexa dots and a show plus multiple wireless outlets and switches plus kindles and copiers and other cameras and we have had no issues like this. I hope if you move forward with this product it works for you.

  I have had my Ring Doorbell Pro installed for roughly 2 weeks now. I was super excited about it when I first installed it because it was my first security camera and I've wanted one for a long time. It initially seemed like a pretty good little camera, with the obvious pluses of being a doorbell (and immediately catching a Fed-Ex guy tossing a package over the railing rather than taking the extra 5 steps around said railing...) and also being able to send me notifications and 2-way communications, live. My biggest issues are as follows:<br><br>1. It seems to pick and choose when it wants to activate night vision (which is apparently only tinted green rather than actually truly colorized) and when it acknowledges that the front porch light and other lights on the front of the house, are on. In green-night vision mode it seems to be super blurry and distort colors like crazy. I haven't figured out what causes this yet because it changes from night to night apparently. When I was testing this, I was wearing a black t-shirt that looked blue, and orange gym shorts that looked grey for some reason. It drops all detail and only leaves the shapes of things. It even cuts out definition of white pieces of trim on the house, next to the door in the attached pictures. You can hardly make out the sidewalk in front of the porch in one picture and it's clear as can be in the other... My $20 Wyze Cams produce far better non-colored night vision video, without the IR lights on! I hopped online and started researching this. A lot of people have had their Ring doorbells just randomly go blurry/reduced image quality (even in the day) and their customer support either says that it's an issue with the customer's wifi and too bad, or they send them a new one. Mine started doing this (only at night so far) after only a week and a half of ownership!<br><br>2. WiFi shows that it's at about -50 (50%). My Wyze Cams are all over the house, further away from the router than the doorbell and read from 96-100%. Those cost $20 for pete's sake! They must be using some super cheap WiFi chips or something if my SUPER SUPER SUPER cheap wireless cameras are reading about 50% better, from up to 2x further away.<br><br>3. This thing gives me notifications all the time for no reason! My motion is set to the 2nd lowest position and I drew detection zones to keep the street and trees out of the motion zone, but it doesn't seem to care. The only thing that might be moving are blades of grass in the wind. I find it hard to believe that's what's causing it when it doesn't even pick up when I'm pulling out of the far side of the driveway even though my car briefly passes through the detection zone set to try to protect the cars from thieves...<br><br>4. Monthly fees. This is on me for not finding a different camera that didn't require $3/mo to save videos. I just accepted it. Then I found several other doorbells cams that aren't as big names, but are still well known and reputable, that don't require a monthly or annual fee. Again I have to look at Wyze Cams because they're so cheap and they store clips for a rolling 14-days, for free. They are definitely much shorter clips, but with a cheap SD card saving up to several days of rolling video, that doesn't matter!<br><br>What it comes down to is this doorbell camera works, but Ring really needs to address their software and also consider reducing their monthly fees. They should offer a model with an SD card slot for continuously rolling video too. I'm guessing the &lt;$7 for an SD card does not outweigh their profits though. For the name-brand and price of this device, I expected a lot more and I'm considering returning it and just sticking another $20 Wyze Cam under the soffit over my door...

  We just bought this and installed it. I have had a security camera system at my home for about 10 years now and I will tell you that the video quality, setup and basically every feature is astronomically better than any camera I have set up at my home. I want to point out that all my current cameras are hard wired for power and video and the quality is ancient compared to the ring doorbell. Now that I've got that out let's get into the meat and potatoes of this thing. First impression after doing some research on how to install this were alittle daunting. Having to mess with the door bell chime as well as replacing my doorbell seemed alittle confusing. After opening the box and seeing they had such detailed instructions and a variety of mounting hardware, I knew I was going to be ok. Other than having to drill into brick to mount the new doorbell (drill bit included) this unit is basically plug and play. After setting it up and downloading the app I realized just how much this thing can do. First off the motion detection is amazing. I had to utilize the customization of motion zones to cut back on how many alerts I was getting, even now I'll get the occasional random shadow of a bird that trips it but before it was picking up every car that drove by. I could go into detail about everything this thing does but it's all listed in the description of the product but I will tell you that every feature has been perfected. I definitely plan to upgrade all my cameras to ring cameras as they are absolutely worth every penny.

  Our Ring Pro was awesome at first. Super clear picture, the motion sensor was perfect. Then one day we had a power outage and it just died. We did everything we could. We called Ring support and they told us it wasn’t the doorbell it was the transformer so we should get an electrician to replace it. We spent $100 to have an electrician come out to replace it and once he replaced it the doorbell still wouldn’t work. At this point we called Ring support again and they said they would send us a new one. This was a really frustrating proces. I kind of wish we just opted for the $20 doorbell.

  This was a good product which worked well for about 2 years, then it lost its wifi connection suddenly (there is nothing wrong with my very strong signal, BTW). I followed all the online troubleshooting suggestions and could not get it to work. Then I called technical support; that person was friendly but simply walked me through all the steps I had already tried. She finally said the unit must be defective. I expressed my dissatisfaction that this $330 unit became dysfunctional after only 2 years. She agreed and asked her manager could something be done; she came back and offered me 35% off a new one. I have spoken with friends about their Ring Pro doorbell and searched online; this seems to be a frequent problem after 1-2 years of use. SO SAVE YOURSELF THE FRUSTRATION AND DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE!!! (I'm looking forward to hearing from Ring/Amazon--yes, Amazon bought Ring in 2018 for over $1 billion).<br><br>UPDATE 5/6/2020:<br>After posting this review I was contacted by Jason from Ring, an Amazon Executive Community Support Representative. He was very friendly and professional and he sent me a brand-new replacement at no charge. The new device seems to be a slightly different build, and hopefully over time will prove to be an improvement over the old design. The new device is working perfectly. It came with the same 1-year original warranty. Jason suggested I consider upgrading to the Ring Protect Plus service which costs $100/year and offers free replacement. So, I'm upgrading my rating to 4 stars thanks to excellent customer service. I still deduct one star since the first device had such a short lifespan. I'll upgrade to 5 stars if the new one lasts 3 years...

  We like this product. When someone arrives at the door the motion is sensed and you are alerted. If you have Alexa she will also announce that someone is at the door. You can log into the app and see in real-time video feed. You must pay a subscription fee after the free trial if you want to be able to look back at the recorded video. Without the subscription, you can only see the live feed. The app also allows other users to notify the community of things such as nearby accidents, break-ins, suspicious activity etc... sadly like all social media people can be brutal and judgmental in their responses to your posts. We did not anticipate the column in our front walkway obstructing a partial view of the camera. It's only an issue at night where the camera light bounces off of it and prevents the night vision to work.

  I have installed my first Ring Pro almost 90 days ago. Installation took about an hour.  The first unit worked intermittently. After working with Ring support for a week, they sent a replacement unit. This unit has worked well for the last 60 days.<br>We ordered a second unit for our other door.  There were several installation issues to overcome.<br>1. The Ring pro worked yet our doorbell chime would not ring.The transformer on this doorbell only put out 12V AC.  Lowes sold a 24V transformer, and it took 30 minutes to replace the old unit.<br>2. Initially this Ring Pro would not connect.  Although the Ring Pro and the router where only 30 feet apart, there were three brick walls between them. Ring support sent a Chime Pro, which we installed half way between the router and Ring Pro.  There is some delay in the video, yet I am satisfied with the performance.<br>3. The old door chime stopped ringing after a few days.  The &gt;20 year old tips of copper wire on our doorbell and the chime needed to be polished up, I cranked the screws down firmly on the Ring Pro, and reset the included clamps on the doorbell chime.  I am going to assume I had an occasional bad connection.<br><br>The 2nd installation was challenging, yet it seems the problems with this 2nd installation were with my infrastructure.

I contacted Support - they were less than stellar.<br><br>Seems they are scripted/programmed to never think the product is bad - its always the customer equipment.  I explained that my Ring PRO had very poor optical focus - and following their script - its the WiFi - ok, played along - reset it as they asked - they still insisted it had packet loss - demonstrated a laptop further away from my access point in line with the Ring was clean - 0% packet loss, 40mb/s speed.  Then it became the voltage is too low - they wanted a picture of the doorbell transformer in the attic - after gently protesting that their app shows the voltage as ""good"" and i wasn't going in the 125' attic to find the transformer - they were back to must be your wifi - even telling me to go purchase a new one :(  - if they do see packet loss from the ring - its in the ring, not my network to their server farm (ping.ring.com if you need to test)<br><br>Now i get it that poor network performance will cause video degradation - and cause significant video artifacts --which to many appear as poor focus (quantization errors, macroblocking)  but that is not what I had - so I gave my Ring PRO glasses and would like to share the video - note my son's face without the added -5 diopter lens and then with.

  Terrible piece of junk...all instructions and videos make it seem like basically plug and play. Ring does not tell you that there are only certain mechanical and digital doorbells the Pro is compatible with. And even then they are full of it, I successfully installed and connected my Ring to my existing doorbell setup, the video worked, the app worked, but it did not ring my simple mechanical doorbell when the button was pressed. I called tech support, they told me my model was not compatible and sent me a list of compatible chimes.<br> I went to Home Depot and picked one up of their list of compatible devices for $20. No big deal. I install the new ""compatible"" doorbell as per their specs and it still did not work. I had 18 volts to the screws on the back of the Ring door switch and it STILL did not ring my doorbell. Once again I call tech support back and explain the whole situation AGAIN..they asked for pictures of how I had the Pro pack installed in the chime, a picture of the transformer, and a picture of how I wired the back of the switch....REALLY?  I have to take everything apart to show you I am not a moron and can put together a couple wires? At this point I was already threatening to send it back but out of idiotic curiosity I obliged and took everything apart and sent pictures of my wiring.  My wiring was fine and they had no clue.<br>I said thank you but I do not have any confidence in this produce OR your tech support.<br>Ring Pro is in the box and being sent back.

  Great product and pretty easy install. I wanted some extra security for my home and after reading mixed reviews in the original product I decided to wait. Glad I did the pro model works very well and I was planning on hardwiring. Most complaints appear to be issues with wifi being to far away. My wifi is about 12' from the front door and works flawlessly.<br>The 2 things to note are that the bell doesn't actual ring in the house for about 5 minutes after the complete install is done. Also you have to set the alarm ""zones"" on the app to get your alerts. Very simple to use and overall very impressed. I've sent videos to family and neighbors to show them the security that is available out there.<br>I like that I also know when packages are delivered so I can decide if I need to have the neighbor grab them or swing by the house.<br>The packaging was very impressive as well and rivaled the number one phone computer company that everyone uses.<br>If your looking at this product and going to hard wire BUY IT.

  After receiving the Ring Pro I went ahead and immediately installed it. I was excited to see that it worked right out of the box after following the instructions. I also have a mechanical doorbell that I wanted to have work in tandem with the Ring Pro.<br><br>At first the Ring Pro only showed a blank screen and wouldn't register any activity or doorbell rings. Disconnected and re-connected and it magically started working (showing video/audio), but no mechanical doorbell activity (NOTE - the original doorbell was always weak sounding). Strange behavior! About 4 hours later it stopped working again. Disconnected and looked at the wiring leads a little closer...they turned out to be oxidized (copper) from being outside for 40+ years and needed a little fine-grit sandpaper to clean them up. Original wiring is from the EARLY 60s on this house! Something to look out for when installing. It was working again. Now, coupled with this behavior I took a meter to my doorbell transformer (also original to the house) and it was only able to generate 11.0 to 13.0v (it fluctuated while I metered it) and it is rated for 16v. So, I bought a Heath-Zenith tri-volt transformer (SL-125-02) for $15 from Amazon, wired it for 16v (it actually produces around 17.9v) and now my mechanical doorbell ding-dongs LOUDLY along with the Ring Pro! I have had ZERO issues for a week since cleaning up the oxidized wiring at the doorbell button area and changing out a failing transformer. So, with some issues to consider with the house's wiring (not the Ring Pro's fault) I would highly recommend the Ring Pro!<br><br>***UPDATE: 1/30/2017<br><br>My Ring Pro continues to work very well. The Heath-Zenith transformer from the above review had to be replaced as it started humming loudly. It never failed, but it buzzed a lot. Replaced with a Honeywell 16v 10A transformer and all is well again. As for continuous functionality of the doorbell...the only downside is the night vision is compromised if you have a bright (but not bright enough) porch light on all night. It seems to fool the night vision into thinking there is enough light...when there really isn't. This isn't the fault of the camera or firmware, but the particular config we have at our house.<br><br>I have also added a couple of Ring cameras in my backyard. They work great and will review them, too.

  I use a top-of-the-line $300 Asus wireless router. The ring doorbell is literally 5 feet away from it. I have replaced the doorbell transformer. With a new one to make sure that it is supplied with Ample power. Yet I have connection issues from time to time. When someone actually rings the doorbell is the most likely time that I will have a connection issue. This leaves me unable to see or speak to the visitor. By the time the issue is resolved the visitor is gone. This is extremely annoying and limits the device usefulness. I have other Wi-Fi devices as do most people. Laptops tablets phones Alexas. All of which maintain their Wi-Fi connections without issue. this is my second ring doorbell. The first one was worse. I used the first one for a couple of years it had been gifted to me. I purchased this second one in August but was still using the original until it  died it was useful as a surveillance camera but not useful as a doorbell. The second one I installed recently and have had some connection issues. I installed it on the 5 GHz side of the router. I may try reinstalling  it on the 2.4 GHz side and see if that works better. If it doesn’t work out I will try a EUFY Doorbell.

  I initially installed a Ring Pro video doorbell for my sister-in-law last fall and I was really impressed with the thought put into ensuring the right connections and extra items necessary for a successful installation were included with the Ring doorbell.  So impressed with the install and functionality that I had to have my own! I have many examples of receiving items requiring installation where directions or hardware to install is missing, but not the case here.  With that said, please check your doorbell transformer first and the video doorbell will require more voltage than a typical ""builder"" mechanical doorbell (I upgraded to a 24V  40 VA transformer that works great with the Ring Pro).<br><br>The Ring Pro doorbell provides clear images in both the day and night time.  Very handy that you can adjust the motion areas and the motion activation to recognize ""people"" as opposed to cars, animals, etc. The voice feature works decent, it does lack some clarity due to a very compact design, but still allows a conversation should you choose to conduct. We took advantage of the Black Friday special that paired the Echo 5 with the Ring Pro.  This is a great pairing, and you can simply instruct the Echo to ""show my front door"" and it will show your ""live"" Ring display.  The basic Ring service is $30/year that stores your video images for 60 days.  Very smart and worthwhile security upgrade, very satisfied!

  I bought the Ring Pro because of the size, the original Ring wouldn't fit in my old doorbell place. This Ring is definitely bigger than a standard doorbell but it's nothing like the original ring.<br>Keep in mind this Ring is HD and requires a very good WIFI and a very fast internet upload speed or you will get a much slower frame rate. Even when connection is bad the images are HD, but you don't get smooth video.<br>This has a few features which are far superior from the Ring, for example the motion detection. My friend has the Ring, and to put the motion setting so that it picks up people reliably it also triggers motion when a car drives by, however the Ring Pro lets you define regions where the motion must be to trigger the notification. It shows you the picture from the Ring Pro, and you add polygons to the image where motion must be inside. I put one on my porch, and one along the path to my porch. Nothing else will trigger motion, and it works great.<br>Installation is a bit confusing. Looking online it says not to use mechanical Ring with the Ring Pro, but I did, and it works just fine. Before you install please read:<br><br>I installed my parents Ring without turning off the power, no problem. I know someone who did that with the Ring Pro, and it killed it. So, please turn off the power before you install the Ring Pro.  You need to open the mechanical Ring for your existing doorbell, and put the Pro Power Pack.  This is really simple. You add the connections to the screws labeled on the transformer in your bell. Then, you remove the existing doorbell wires from the transformer, and put the Ring two wire harness in their place. You run the doorbell wires into the wire clips on the harness and that's it. Plug the wire harness into the pro power pack and use the double sided tape to mount the tiny power pack into the bell, making sure it won't interfere with the mechanical ringing. Replace the cover and you're done with this step.<br>Remove the original doorbell. Remove the cover off the Ring Pro. Attach the two wires to the two screws on the Ring Pro, using the existing wires or the extra wires included. Attach the doorbell to your wall, dont replace the decorative color yet. Go turn on the power now, and follow the app to install the Ring and you're done. Last, replace the decorative cover of your choice from the three colors included.<br>Now make sure you setup the app, for how you want it to work. I use Wink for my home automation and it integrates well. I can use motion from the doorbell, or a ring, to trigger other home automation action. I have a Schlage wireless deadbolt and you can control it from the Ring app once it's installed. It's really well done for home automation.<br>I love using the doorbell when I am out of state. No one knows if I am home or not. All the video is stored on the cloud from motion to rings, for a small change, something like &lt;$20/yr. perfect for home security.<br><br>This is the best addition for home security, it's better than an alarm system.

  Traded in our SimpliSafe for this, mostly because of how quickly and effectively Ring responded to disclosed vulnerabilities. Turns out that this camera has much better low-light quality, and you have more control over the device, as well. You can set which sections of the video the device looks for movement in, how sensitive it is to motion, and suppress motion alerts manually our on a schedule. You can also setup routines for the alerts: I setup separate pirate-themed notifications for motion detection and when the doorbell was rung (which my kids loved).<br>I saw some reviewers that had trouble with the wireless connection: I have an eero setup, and one of my units is about 30’ from the doorbell, so I haven’t had any issues.

  I have the greatest respect for technology however in this case not so much for the manufacturer. I bought this model because it allowed me to hardwire to the transformer in my door chime. Ring supplies a power device that ""assures"" that you have enough power to work the ring device correctly. What they do not tell you is that the power device or even the Ring device may not be compatible with all Door Chime transformers. in my case after I hooked up to the transformer and installed the Ring, turned on the electric and the chimes were going off on their own with a loud buzzing sound. I disconnected the Ring device and power unit and reconnected the door chime and it is still buzzing. So now I am out a door chime and wasted a bunch of time putting holes in my door frame. Why there was not a notice in the installment material about compatibility issues is a mystery to me. Calling Ring after the my transformer was blown to discuss this will not help me or anyone else. Put a list or a call number for this information in the installment instructions is the responsibility of the manufacturer. I have returned the item and also lost $35 from an amazon gift card.

Even while the house is in demolition mode, we still have the new security system (including the cameras) online. We also have friends who have Ring things and we have a friend who works at Ring who raves about the tech. So, we bought the Doorbell Pro and the Floodlight. Now that they're hooked up and running, we feel even more secure. The security system is great, but having the Floodlight and the Doorbell video feeds is even better! Ultimately, it would be great if we could integrate the various systems, but since the apps for our security system, the Ring products, our garage door, and even our HVAC system are all so simple and easy to use, we're still thrilled to have so much control from anywhere.<br><br>There are a couple of user experience things in the Ring app that could be improved, but I understand from the support people there that those are being addressed already. I had to call support on the Floodlight because of a WiFi issue. Our fiber optic router was blocking things a bit, so the installation didn't go as smoothly as it could have. I was eventually able to figure out what setting in the router was causing the issue. Everything is awesome!<br><br>As for the installation, I'm a DIY/maker/tinkerer, so nothing was difficult at all for either the Doorbell or the Floodlight products. I had to do a complete install for the Floodlight (cut a hole above the garage door, run a new electrical wire, install a box, the light, etc.). That's not difficult if you're a DIY kinda person. It's even easier if there is an existing floodlight box ready to go. The software side of everything is dead simple, as long as your WiFi system doesn't have any nutty security settings going on.<br><br>Our friends who have the Doorbell have constantly recommended it to us, and now that we're Doorbell users, we can't stop recommending it ourselves. It's an inexpensive way of watching what's going on at your front door (or around the property, if you have a Floodlight or two).

1.0 out of 5 stars,Ring Pro doesn’t work beyond the first couple months,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2020","<span>
  Unfortunately, I can echo the many bad reviews and want to make sure that I add our own experience with the Ring Pro Doorbell for the good of future buyers.<br>After a couple of months it stoped working entirely despite sufficient power and wifi. Neither the app or the company would contact us and let us know. So, half a year goes by before we noticed that the doorbell doesn’t work at all. In the meantime, I was paying for their video storage blissfully unaware that this doorbell camera will never again record a video or alert me to anybody approaching our door. My attempts to get in touch with Ring have been unsuccessful and a my many hours and days trying to solve this issue have cumulatively been more expensive than the doorbell itself. In my opinion, this is one of these hyped gadgets that doesn’t deliver at all. The video quality is poor, transmission rates have been ridiculously slow even when it worked. Anything I recorded with its motion detection was the back of people when they were leaving our door steps. So, no, I won’t get a Ring product again.<br>Can anybody recommend a more reliable doorbell with camera? I am in need for a new one that actually works.

  UPDATE: After new firmware was finally pushed to the device it works as advertised.<br><br>Unit is decent. Live view and motion view work pretty well. Unfortunately Snapshot Capture doesnt work. With an RSSI of 60-65, that should be enough. Tried twice in chat support to work on it, both times I hit the back button on my phone and disconnected. Every other remote service ticket system and process would start at where we left off but not this one. Had to restart the whole process. Once my subscription to their cloud storage expires, I'll probably move on to something  else. Another irritating thing is that I can't force a firmware update. All the noise about check unit health then start live view and it will update is wrong. Doesnt happen and Ring doesn't read emails.<br><br>So here's the thing... if you want an ok camera plus the neighborhood alerts etc., buy it. But return it if anything doesn't work because there is zero support.

2.0 out of 5 stars,balky connectivity and poor microphone,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2018","<span>
  The whole system is disappointing. The sluggish Ring App, likely a function of Ring's severs, is annoying. The second night, I had to reset the whole system for no apparent reason. The Ring App said ""press the reset button"" but didn't tell me to remove the decorative cover with a special tool beforehand, so that took an extra ten minutes. Our pictures look better than many other Ring users perhaps because of device location minimizing back-lighting. I boost my router's wifi signal with a Netgear  range extender. I have this doorbell Pro, two ""spotlight cameras"" with solar chargers and Chime Pro. I have high speed cable internet service. See my review of the ChimePro wi-fi signal extender elsewhere. While voice can be heard outside through the Ring Pro doorbell's speaker and the cameras' speakers, when I speak toward the cameras, my wife can't hear me inside at all with the cameras and sometimes with the Pro doorbell. I'll update this if there is some magic solution to this that I discover later. I got this system because of the spotlights with the cameras, and because most of my neighbors with video doorbells use it rather than another such system. We had Amazon Home Services instlal the doorbell and one of their third party installers install the cameras and solar panels. I get the feeling this is all early days for the Ring App. The video reliability doesn't compare favorably to Facetime or to What'sApp.

  I just learned that after thirty days your Ring doorbell stops working unless you pay a $3.00 monthly fee. I do not find reference to this fee other than if you want to use the Cloud for video storage is the fee applicable. Why does Ring expect a fee if this product is only being used on your private server and does not involve them ????? Robbery<br><br>My first Ring Pro was a dud but the replacement installed and operated perfectly without any flaws. The video is extremely good and facial recognition is fantastic.  What I would like to purchase next is the yard model with the two yard lights but what Ring offers only mounts on a vertical surface. I need a model that will mount on a horizontal surface such as the soffit of the house.

  I bought this in May if 2017 and loved it at first. I even recommended it to countless neighbors but over time it stopped detecting people walking up to the door, it would take forever to pull up the video when it did notify you and just a few days ago it stopped working all together. I have talked to ring support and they don’t know what happened buts it’s past the one year warranty so I’m out of luck. Not going to drop another $200 for two years of use when it never worked that good to begin with.

  Installed this a year ago, install was easy if you have basic skills to connect wires.  The first unit I had, video was fine, audio was bad, even the support rep said so, so they sent another unit, same thing.  I thought maybe it's my transformer or wiring, so kept it. This last summer I purchased a new transformer with plenty of power, I rewired the entire doorbell/low voltage system with quality wire (the transfer also powers the address lights).  When I was done, same thing, what a waste of time and money.  Also, I already had 100MBps cable modem connection with 35MBps upload.  I'm now at 1Gbps download and about 40Mbps to 50Mbps, same thing.  Tried connecting to 5G instead of older wifi, same thing.  I get full speed from the wireless testing on phone from just outside where unit is installed.  So now I'm looking for an alternative, but can't find anything as of yet.  It's too bad, I've read many others have had the same problem.  Maybe they need to issue a recall if they have found a problem.

  I've been very pleased with the device, which I've had for about a month, but I felt that the information on the website about the installation for the Doorbell Pro was a bit lacking. Despite reading all of the information very carefully, in the end I needed a handyman to come out and install it, and that would not have been the case with the basic Doorbell. More to the point, I tried to avoid this by reading the information very carefully, but a few things were not clear (like the size of the hole you have to drill, etc.). But their customer service has been excellent, and the device works exactly as advertised. You will definitely need the subscription for the videos too, so you better plan that into your thinking.

  This a two day review so far.  I installed the Ring Doorbell quickly and easily with very little reading through the instructions.  Two wires to connect on the device, another 2 at the mechanical ringer and I was off.  Restored power to the breaker box and the Ring device was in setup mode.  Everything was done in 30 minutes time or less I would say taking my time.  Everything was working perfectly.  The next day I looked at it and it was stuck in night mode.  I was at work so I couldn't fiddle with it there but decided to call Ring customer support.  I told them about the night mode problem and they remoted into my device and noticed I was on Firmware version 1.4.30.  (Note, you can see this info in Device Health fellow ring users on your app)  It took around a few hours to download and install and now its working perfectly in color and I'm on Firmware version 1.8.121.  I would make sure that all Ring users are on that firmware version or newer to prevent issues like the one that I had.  I asked and I don't believe that you can push firmware updates as a user.  Just call them up and tell them to push the update.  So far I am VERY happy with my purchase even if I can to call in a tech support call.  Not a big deal to me.  Hope this helps others out on this purchase.

  I bought an early unit. Since the beginning, the unit kept going offline every few weeks to a month. Called ring, they had me reset, check signal strength etc. This goes on for the next two years of having the unit go offline every once in a while.<br>Last few months,  it was going offline much more frequently as in every few days to a week.<br>I feel I was basically nursed passed the warranty period so to avoid replacing my early production unit. I, quite frankly also am to blame. I simply got tired of calling them....over and over.<br>RIng; Take responsibility for your defective early production units. Ring refused to do anything for me regardless of how long this was going on for. They know how many times it went offline if they care to want to know. They claimed it was signal strength or bad installation etc. etc.<br>Yes. It's a signal strength issue, only I believe it is the ring has the issue.<br>Got Arlo instead and works perfectly installed in the exact same place.<br>Update; as of December 7th I was able to explain this to a senior member of the ring team. They are going to replace my unit with a tested replacement. No one should have to go through this to get good customer service, though I'm happy to report that they did the right thing in the very long end.

  Installation was fairly easy but when it came to setup via the Ring App my unit did not connect to WiFi &amp; after a chat with Ring help who had me power it down it never came back to Setup Mode. Ring sent me a replacement unit as they said the first one maybe defective, but the replacement wouldn't connect to my Wifi either, Ring Help said the problem was that the Ring App that was running on my Android Fire HD 10 Tablet was a poor Android device &amp; the app doesn't run well enough to install the Doorbell Pro, I didn't have another Android device which is the only way to install the unit so I sent both of them back. I will say that the Ring people at their Help line are very patient &amp; friendly &amp; calls to their help line are answered in less then 5 min. Overall it looks like a useful product but if you don't have a GOOD android device for the setup don't waste your time with it!

  I will start of by saying this is an excellent product, worth the money.<br><br>That being said, if you have an older home, you may need to do some simple upgrades to make this work. Buy a multi-meter, test the voltage at the doorbell. (YouTube videos can help explain this.) If your voltage is less than 16V, you may not have enough power to run the Ring Pro, or it will run but not chime your doorbell. If this is the case, you'll need to replace your transformer with a 16VAC-30VA transformer. (About $25-30). You may also need to replace your chime mechanism, if it's mechanical, to a newer, more compatible one. Ring has a list of compatible Mechanical &amp; Digital chimes. ($25 for a simple mechanical one.)<br><br>I had 9V at my doorbell. It would run the Ring, but did not have enough power to chime the doorbell. It would also randomly disconnect, I suspect due to a drop in voltage. Once I replaced my transformer and chime, it works like a charm!

  I'm very sad about this product.  After 3 years it completely stopped working.  I called support and they said it was a hardware issue that necessitates buying the latest model to fix.  They were going to give me a 35% discount to purchase this.  In my mind, if you're buying a couple hundred dollar doorbell, it should last for more than 3 years.  I believe in their product, but this really doesn't make me feel good about their customer service and longevity of the device.  After 1 hour on the call with Ring, there was nothing better they could offer and they ended up just hanging up on me.  After being purchased by Amazon, I would've thought that ""customer obsession"" would help, but apparently not.<br><br>[update] was contacted by Ring support here in the US today and they offered a replacement doorbell for me.  This is the outcome I would've wanted from the original customer service call.  I'm glad they were able to make it right, but it did still take several weeks.

  Overall I am pleased with this product, but unless you have better than 2 Meg internet speed, both upload and download, the video and audio is very choppy and hard to use.  I have two WIFI networks, one DSL which gives 6 Meg down and 780 K up.  My other network is HughesNet Gen 5 which gives 25 meg down and 7 meg up, but with the unavoidable latency that all satellite systems will always have.  Neither network yields good audio or video.  The unit also requires a super strong WIFI signal.  I ended up getting the Ring WIFI extender and placing it on an outlet on the inside will within feet of the doorbell unit.  This gave good enough signal performance that I could use it.<br>I also have two other chime units located in other parts of the home.  Install and wiring was simple.  Our existing doorbell system had an 18 volt transformer so power was no problem.  (16 volt systems, which are common, are marginal to power this unit).<br>One feature I was not sure I would like is the motion sensing.  The app allows the setting of an alert area and sensitivity to motion.  I have it set to alert if anything enters our driveway or the porch.  This feature works great and is now one of my favorite parts of it.<br>I also have the cloud storage feature enabled which lets me look at any motion or door ring events that happen,. Very nice to see what is going on at home.<br>Back on the negative side, the speaker in the unit is quite small, audio quality very tinny and poor quality, and the volume is not adjustable.  All of this combines the make it very difficult for anyone you are trying to talk to to understand.  The unit also runs very hot to the touch. I am not sure how well it will stand up over time.<br><br>Updated - Unit goes offline and misses motion events quite often. After working with support, I was informed this unit requires at least 2 Mb download AND UPLOAD internet speed to work.  I have two networks available, one is DSL with 6 meg down and 0.8 meg up, the other is Hughesnet Gen5 satellite which gives at least 25 meg down and 5 meg up.  This device is intermittent on both networks.  I bought a Ring chime pro and have it within 3 feet of the doorbell. It helped some but problems remain. The bottom line, It still misses motion events, and will go offline a few times each day.<br>If you are considering a purchase of this unit and do not have a good internet connection, (something better than DSL) you should think again.  DSL and Satellite just wont support it.

Only complaints would be:<br><br>1) Video quality isn't quite as crisp as shown on their website even though I have blazing fast internet and the ring is only about 10ft from my router.<br>2) You have to pay a subscription fee to have your videos stored and accessible for viewing later.

  I've had this doorbell for about 18 months.  I really wanted to like it, but it is utterly unreliable.  I have rock-solid gigabit wireless, using professional grade hardware (it's my business).  Initially the ring worked pretty well, only dropping signal occasionally and showing ""live view"" 90% of the time.  But after six months it has degraded.  Now it's a joke between my wife and I.

Everything has been well-thought out:<br><br>The package comes with corner wedges that allow mounting at different angles. Very useful for situations where the doorbell is on a side wall. The fisheye lens was initially a concern, but since doorbells are at waist height rather than eye level, it does the best job at capturing both faces and all the background action. Video and audio quality are good.<br><br>Multiple faceplates allow the Ring Pro to blend naturally with most paint schemes.<br><br>The Ring phone application is very robust and allows a lot of personal adjustment to the notifications.<br><br>And then there's the Ring community social network that lets users easily share videos of interest (stolen packages, suspicious people, etc) to the community or law enforcement. Real-time cloud video uploads are very reasonable at just $30 per year.<br><br>And Ring is partnered with Amazon, so I got free professional installation from an Amazon technician, and my Ring is fully integrated with my Echo show so that I just say ""Alexa, show me the front door"" and I can see it on the screen.

With ""Good"" wifi signal and ""Very Good"" voltage (~19V) according to the Device Health, I'm getting solid performance.  The customizable movement detection zones with the Pro model have been very useful due to my particular situation with neighbors and street traffic.<br><br>All that said, the first Ring Pro I received from Amazon was a total waste of time as it would not boot up at all.  When opening the package I suspected it was a return as the sealing tape had been sliced.  As I continued to unbox it, it was quite obvious the item was used:  Loose stickers and documentation, partially assembled wiring, parts not bagged, etc..  I thought I'd give it a try anyway and of course, it was a dead unit.  I immediately ordered another one and sent this defective one back to Amazon.  Before boxing up the bad unit, I made sure to clearly mark the package and the Ring unit itself as ""Defective/Used"" so that Amazon would hopefully not sell it as new to another customer.<br><br>My advice to anyone buying this item from Amazon is to very closely examine the packaging for signs that it's been previously opened and/or installed.  The box should be sealed at both ends with circular shaped tape, and everything should be neatly organized inside.  If you find evidence that it's been installed, I recommend returning it and not wasting your time as it's most likely going to be a bad experience.  I'm betting a good deal of the negative reviews here are likely due to folks getting returned merchandise that was defective from the start, or was damaged by a previous installer.<br><br>Good luck!

  It records, it has motion sensors, it alarms me if someone presses the doorbell. It does what it's suppose to do except stay in color during the day time like it's suppose to.

I have restarted it numerous amounts of time by turning the power off by the breaker. Sometimes it worked and set it back to color during the day but once nightfall happens it goes into night mode  (infrared) and stay throughout the remainder. I wouldn't care but the video quality is poor during the infrared compared to the colored vision and it stays hot to the touch because of the infrared.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Worthless Installation Instructions,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2018","<span>
  I opened the Ring box and reviewed the multi-fold instructional pieces. Hmmm, seem too simple to be true, and was I correct. Mr. Siminoff,  really, there are many variables that you and your team have not considered when you penned your cute limited instructional piece. So let me begin...  First, my home is 20 years old and so is the mechanical chime doorbell. I installed the system and come to find out my 20 yo doorbell is not compatible with the Ring doorbell. I had to call customer service and have the customer service rep email to me the compatible doorbell list. It was emailed and I  headed down to Lowes and purchased a compatible mechanical doorbell chime. I installed the new chime. Unfortunately, the system was set up on my original doorbell chime. I could not set up system. I had a constant white blinking light... I called customer service again (Anastasia was awesome). She helped and had to explain that I must reset the system and I had to shut off the power to doorbell  at the circuit breaker for 2 min. Then I was told to hold the side button on the doorbell for 15 seconds. I did this multiple times. Finally, it went to a spinning white wheel. From the time I started to the time it was completed, it took 4 hours to install. I was out of my mind that it took so long. Now, here's the kicker... the front of my house faces directly west. At around 4pm, the sun is directly on the front door and doorbell. Soooo.... if the Ring doorbell is in extreme heat or cold when someone rings the doorbell. The indoor chime will not ring... REALLY! BUT nowhere in the cute instructional pieces is this explained. NOWHERE!!!! So I spent an HOUR troubleshooting with and Ohm meter.  I was ready to rip it out of the wall and put the old system back in place. Then my wife found out, from the website, that extreme heat will do this. Mr. Siminoff, for $199 you can afford to put in an instructional booklet that will help the installer install your system and troubleshoot. Stop being cute and thinking your system's installation is self explanatory. IT'S NOT! Give your customers the instructional tools to properly install your Ring doorbell. What would an instructional pamphlet cost? It probably already has cost you many a customer. I cannot imagine that goes over well with your shareholders.  Last, now that the system is up and running it works and my wife likes it. For future buyers of the Ring doorbell. Open box, read the worthless cute instructional cards, call customer service, ask for the compatible doorbell chime list, go to Lowes/Home Depot, buy new system if you don't have an late model chime. Install, call customer service and have them walk you through the set-up, because the cute instructional cards are worthless...  JAMIE hopefully you are reading this, but somehow I doubt it.

  Great product. Be aware of the $30 a year/$3 a month for cloud storage as there is no built in SD card, but you don't have to worry about someone stealing the device either. This has to be hard-wired and requires a doorbell transformer that can put out 16 volts. I tested mine before ordering. It's fairly easy to do if you have a multimeter. I was also able to use my existing mechanical door chime. The lower profile and smaller width compared to the Ring or Ring 2 make the Pro more attractive. Motion detection is top notch as is the night-vision. Definetly recommend this product.

   I'll update this review if/when I'm able to complete the installation. The install was going fine until a mounting screw head snapped off before being fully seated into the plastic housing to secure the Ring Video Doorbell Pro to the wall.<br><br>I even pre-drilled the wall to make it easier on the screw and I hand tightened the screw to avoid over torquing the head. All to no avail. Poor quality, made in China, metal screws strike again. Your device does the consumer no good if we can't even get it on the wall to begin with Amazon.<br><br>I don't even know if I'll be able to extract the broken screw from the plastic housing without damaging or breaking the housing all together. My advice to anyone considering buying this device: visit your local hardware store and buy better mounting screws to replace the junk screws that Amazon includes with the install kit. Better luck to all of you.

  Initially we ran into a few issues installing it. During set-up the unit wasn't talking nor were we able to get past the ring network phase of the set-up. We immediately called Ring's customer service and they walked us through the factory reset phase two times. After the second time, they asked us to send pictures of how everything was connected so that they could see if we had connected it correctly. We emailed the pictures while still talking to the service rep and they informed us that the transformer was not the correct voltage. After replacing the transformer and performing a factory reset it still didn't work. We resent new pictures to customer service and they immediately shipped us a new unit with a return label for the first one. The replacement unit arrived in less than a week and has worked perfectly ever since. We also purchased an adjustable mount because our doorway is like a small box. The Ring app allows us to customize the area for motion. Initially, we used the standard area but received to many notifications because it was catching all the cars driving by all day. We customized the motion zones so that we would only be notified if someone was on our front lawn all the way up to the door. So far, it has worked perfectly. One benefit to having the Ring Pro is that our front door doesn't have a peephole so we no longer have to look out the window or ask ""Who's there?"" We can see everyone clearly, day and night. Another benefit is the ability to disable motion alerts. My spouse leaves for work very, very, very early in the morning. On those days and time, I set the app to disable the alert feature.

  Works as advertised once fully set up, though setting it up was really an exercise in trial and error. It's not supposed to matter which wire you connect to which connector on the back of the unit, but for me, it mattered for some reason (one way worked, and the other did not).

I ended up having to call the customer support line to ask what to do when I was only able to get the doorbell outside or in the house to work, and they told me this trick over the phone. I had asked them why this wasn't just in the manual, and the (unacceptable) response I got was basically that ""oh not that many people run into this so we just wait for them to call us with problems.""

  We joined the Ring gang. My electrician talked me into trying this out and then adding the Ring security cameras if I like it. 🤷🏽‍♀️<br><br>Pros:<br>• It will be convenient to see people approach and be alerted when someone is near my house and have that interaction recorded. This unit also has a two way communication. So you can speak to people through the speaker. Long gone are the days where you have to crack open the door or yell at the door. Had CJ test out the features so he can be comfortable with it as well. I pretended to be a solicitor and we played around with the app and unit.<br><br>• Two way communication is clear! I am very impressed with the clarity both outside for a visitor and through my app on my phone.<br><br>• Cheaper unit compared to other cameras I was looking at ($249 for this Doorbell camera vs $800+ for outdoor security cameras)<br><br>• Quick setup for newer homes (it requires specific tech to support the device and I have good WiFi and mechanical setup for my current Doorbell)<br><br>• 1080 clarity on the camera - this thing is crystal clear when someone is near the unit which is fantastic. Just have to see how it holds up at night.<br><br>• Easy to install - I had my electrician come install my unit because he was going to be here to replace a wire for my yard lights that was clipped by my landscaper some weeks back. I watched him and it was very quick easy setup. Most labor involved was drilling the holes into the brick.<br><br>Cons:<br>• Ring tries its best to avoid telling you that this unit DOES require the monthly / annual subscription service to be functional. They don’t allow you to save the videos locally. $30/year cloud service. Bothered that the rest of my life I’ll have to pay this (assuming it never goes up). It’s even more incentive for me to finish the rest of the lighting around my home and get my own cameras and hard drive in to avoid the costs. (Yes I’m that cheap).  They tell you that you can still use the features without the subscription, however if you want to access video from more than a few minutes ago - it requires cloud storage which is where you need their service!<br><br>• The motion alert feature is touchy. I turned it off because otherwise my phone alerts are going off constantly because I live on a main road in the neighborhood- if a car drives by, alert goes off.<br><br>• Ring says this can be connected to Alexa which is a VAGUE statement. What they mean is : if you have an Alexa device AND purchase an AMAZON ECHO DEVICE - THEN you can connect Ring to your Alexa device. Specifically the benefit is I wanted to see my front door camera on my television screens in my home by saying “Alexa - show me my front door”. This isn’t possible without the Echo. Glad I purchased the unit that included a FREE ECHO device, but I have to wait for it to arrive as it’s shipping separate which is annoying.<br><br>• Cheaper units of the Ring can be powered by battery and don’t require a hardwire connection. I chose one that was hardwired because I read various feedback about the issues people had with battery powered devices. This unit also connects to my doorbell unit so I can still get my doorbell chime throughout my house. Sounds awesome but took a lot of troubleshooting and resetting my unit to both chime in my home and receive the chime on my phone. This is important because if you’re in your house and not near your phone - you wouldn’t know someone is at your door if you don’t connect everything.<br><br>• Also find it hard to believe developers haven’t allowed the Echo to act as a doorbell chime for those that don’t have a doorbell in their home.

  I previously bought the Ring 2 and I had lots of problems with it (black screen), takes forever to load. The Ring Pro has none of those problems. It's been flawless for me. However, I did have to upgrade my transformer to a 24v ahead of time. I did not test it with a 12v transformer so I suspect that may have been the issues for some.<br><br>In any case, I heard the Nest Hello is superior, but it cost $60 a year to maintain. This one is essentially free because I am currently paying for the Ring Alarm system. It's no brainer for me. Having the ability to tell me who's at the door is not worth $30 a month ($35 for Nest alarm, and $5 for nest hello).<br><br>This plus the Ring Alarm is one of the best invention ever!

  I have installed many Nest Hello and Amazon Ring doorbells, the products are both very good and In my opinion you can hardly go wrong with either. The one and only reason I went with Ring is the fact that I have an Amazon/Alexa house with half a dozen Echo show, Echo Dots, and FireTV devices throughout my house and Ring integrates better with Alexa for showing the video feed thru FireTV and for notifications thru all the Echo devices when someone rings the bell. Also, all my home automation equipment was already connected thru the Alexa assistant. Personally I do think the Google aesthetics are better but not by a lot. I had a properly wired doorbell and did not need the wireless doorbell option (which Nest doesn't offer) so I went with the Ring pro for better night vision and it also has a better motion sensor than the standard Ring or Ring 2. Very happy with the purchase.

  Good novelty for couple of days. I would rather get arlo that provides all features and stay with your original door bell. Arlo provides free basic video recording service whereas Ring will start charging after a month. Good doorbell at this price should provide ability to store video locally instead of getting into recurring cost, it is like half baked security system. Arlo and I am sure others provides local storage. So unless you are up for monthly subscription or settling just as a notification on your phone when someone rings the ring, consider alternative. Also, given the device plays with serial connectivity and current flow, I spent several calls with Ring support with final recommendation to ditch my original chime. Mine is going back.

  This thing has a lot of faults. It’s cool.  Don’t get me wrong. I like that I’ll know who’s around my home when I’m not. However, there are some really frustrating things about this device. First off is the setup.  It’s miserable.  The worst part is any time you want to change your WiFi network you have to take the security screw out of the device and press the button on it. That’s so stupid.  I don’t see how that is a convenient or extra secure feature.  It’s just annoying.  Then there are all the times where it will just spin because of interference.  I’ve read a lot of reviews complaining about interference so it is definitely a common problem. So pay $250 for the thing and then you can’t answer or see at the most important time?  It’s not that fun to set up either and the sensitivity is frustrating. It’s detects snow if it’s up too high.  The videos are super clear great quality and it does make you feel more secure knowing you can see what’s going on 24/7.  However I think it’s a touch hyped.  You can get a wireless security system for the same price as this doorbell and see everything.  They hold you for ransom to record your videos after charging exorbitant sums of money for the stupid thing. That’s because of people like my wife’s ex who would pay a million dollars just to be able to control his lights with Alexa.  I don’t know.  Technology is cool but it’s also a pain. Don’t listen to the five star reviews because even if this thing worked perfectly it couldn’t be five stars.

  I bought the Ring Pro doorbell over a year ago and had no trouble setting it up. The power level was consistently Good to Very Good and the device performed well for the first year. But I noticed a few weeks ago that the device stopped recording sound. Sound came back for a couple of days but has died again for weeks. Wifi was reset etc, but sound is gone again. Without sound the device is mostly useless because you can't answer the doorbell and speak with the person at the door. I also noticed that for no apparent reason the voltage indicator on the app swings from Very Good to Poor and stays Poor for a short while. This does not happen all the time (the voltage is usually Very Good), but it worries me and it definitely did not happen a year ago. Perhaps the AC to DC power regulator of the device is deteriorating? Will this device actually last more than a year or so?

  Update: I've downgraded my review from 5 stars to 3 stars. The reason is that I'm now on my third doorbell. The button cracked on the first one, so ring sent me a new one. The second one completely stopped working. After some back and forth with tech support ring sent me a new one - by ordinary shipping. This meant that I went for several days without a working doorbell because ring cheeped out on shipping. It's bad enough that I'm on my third doorbell, but to leave me without a working doorbell for a few days just to save a few bucks is really bad.<br><br>------<br><br>This was easy to install and has a relatively low profile compared to the battery powered ring doorbell. The motion detection is effective and has very few false positives. I do have a few quibbles: 1) A few times, the doorbell has rung outside, but there was no inside bell or notification that the bell had been rung, 2) there is a noticeable lag before things are synced up on the web. This means that if you don't open the notification immediately and view live video from your phone, you need to wait a few minutes before you can view the clip stored in the cloud, 3) the web interface is not very convenient and logs you out frequently.

  Works as described. Easy set up but pay attention to voltage requirements on existing doorbell. You may need to change out your doorbell transformer to achieve the 16 Volt requirement which I did prior to receiving the Ring Pro from advice of Ring customer support which was excellent. Also, your Wifi signal may be an issue as it was with mine. Ring customer support was outstanding in addressing this issue and sent me the Chime Wifi Extender which solved the problem. Functionality and ease of use are superb. One small negative is the audio quality not so good. Audio breaks up but this may be do to strength/speed of my Wifi router which is several years old. Also, unlike other providers Ring has no means to store the activity to a local drive and forces you to use their cloud storage. Like to see them address this in future product update.

Especially recently, the motion detection is hyper sensitive, alerting me every 5 seconds (should be every 60 seconds) but when I try to view the camera, it never loads and the detections don’t register in the history log so who the heck knows what happened out there.

  I love this Ring Doorbell. It was a bit pricey, even on sale. But probably worth it for the peace of mind of having your front door constantly monitored. It has a deterrent effect on people coming up to my door to bother me, as many times, once solicitors or other random strangers walk up and see it, they just walk away (sometimes you get a ""fake"" door bell ring where they touch the button, but don't actually push it and then just walk away).<br><br>If you want to be able to access past recordings, or missed events, you have to pay an additional monthly (or yearly) fee. I'm pretty cheap, but I decided to pay it, as it is reasonable and the ability to go back through 30 days of recorded events is worth it.  Plus, Ring is constantly adding new items and improving its lineup. I have a feeling this is something that will be a part of my home for the foreseeable future.  I'll probably eventually add more of their spotlights and cameras around the house.

  I love this Ring Doorbell Pro, but make sure you upgrade the transformer to at least 18 volts.  I installed my Ring Doorbell Pro, not knowing that my transformer was only 10 volts.  For those of you who don’t know what a transformer is, it’s what transforms the house 110 volt electricity to a lower voltage (16, 18 or 24 volts).  And just so you know, it’s not in your doorbell.  The transformer in my house was located in my basement crawl space below where my doorbell was mounted on the wall upstairs.  The transformer was attached on the outside of the light box and wired into the light box in the crawl space (see picture)  All I had to do was disconnect all the wires, remove the old transformer and wire in the new transformer.

Once received, I mounted one of the 3 wedges to the siding, then using the doorbell's original mounting screws, attached the doorbell to the wedge. It turned out perfect. BTW --- The video instructions for wedge installation say to use the short screws that come in the wedge kit. INCORRECT. The heads are too large. Just use the short ones that came with the doorbell.<br><br>Aside from the added benefit of always knowing who's coming up to my door, I really like the fact that when packages are delivered, I know! Our mail carrier NEVER rings, or knocks., It no longer matters. That in itself is worth getting the ring.

  This product is not ready for the marketplace. The app is clearly not working as design. When the app connects, the response is slow and marginal at best. Most of the time, the app connects after 1-4 minutes of trying to connect. By the time the video loads, the person that rang the door is long gone. Even to see the replay the response time is very slow!<br><br>There is an unusual delay from the door chime to the bell inside of the house. It takes about 5-10 seconds for the bell to ring inside after the device outside has pressed. I am confused as to why there is a reason for the delay.<br><br>Video quality does not appear to be 1080P HD. Instead, it looks more like a cheap old camera. The reason to purchase is for high-quality video. I also don't understand why the cloud fee.

The communities only seem to display common problems yet nothing outside the box approach to fixing problems.<br><br>The build quality is of high quality. The cables are clearly labeled, and the package comes with all needed to install. Very similar to an iPhone box or Nest for example.<br><br>Lastly, the best way to describe the product, this product sucks! Has potential and much marketing but that is about it.

  The doorbell works OK. There is usually a delay when the door bell detects motion and can sometimes be useless when catching people that walk straight in through the door without knocking. the video quality ins't bad, but isn't all that good either. My biggest issue with the doorbell is the customer service and their lack of knowledge on the doorbell. they give you a diode to install if you have a digital chime. When I installed the diode on my last customers ring (I am an installer) the digital chime wouldn't stop chiming until I removed the diode. Then it worked perfectly fine. I called ring for support on the matter before removing the diode and they told me my chime was not compatible with their doorbell, but was showing on the compatible list on their website. Customer service is a joke.

  My specs: Google Wifi and Android, the connection/set up was easy (although it took a few minutes for the doorbell to find my Google WiFi, it was finding the neighbor's), the App is good, very easy to use. Image quality is good, no issues with tweaking the sensitivity to avoid unnecessary alerts. Interesting feature on the App that you can see reports of suspicious activity in your area (the radius it captures is adjustable) and report your own. So overall,m very happy and would highly recommend.<br><br>With that said, venting on two issues. First, the quality of the fasteners include is horrible, two screw heads broke off while attaching, creating grief and frustration . No reason not to spend 25 cents more for better quality fasteners.  Use extreme caution when using a cordless screwdriver/drill and ratchet down the down the torque. Second, the angled mounting plate does not provide much of an angle, I purchased a 3rd party mounting plate that provides multiple mounting angles. The problem is primarily with the light activation at night, if you have a wall near your doorbell at a 90 degree angle, the light hits the wall effectively washing out the image due to the reflection. With a 30+ degree angled mount, the problem was eliminated. Ring should include an adjustable angled mount instead of making me buy one for $8.99.

  I bought this camera mainly to see who was ringing the doorbell. And for that it works great. Mainly because the camera live view only takes 5 seconds to show who is ot the door. Sooo, As long as the person stays at the door it works good. The problem comes when someone is dropping something off and leaving. the ring records the person coming and going, but it takes 20 seconds for the camera to process the  motion from the time I open the app. So 5 seconds to get live view and 20 seconds to see the motion. Most delivery people are already in their truck after 25 seconds..Which is ok unless it's a porch pirate. In that case you won't even have time to get a license plate. And forget about identifiing someone from the camera. I couldn't ID my own family with this camera.<br><br>Motion sensitivity is also just ok. I have 2 zones set up and neither zone extends past my porch. I can walk in front of my house 10 times and it will trigger the motion at least once in those ten times. I also have it set for people only yet a cat or dog occasionally trips it..Not a major complaint, but annoying.<br><br>For seeing who is ringing your bell it works great, for every thing else, just so so..

  I had heard that the latency (delay) of Ring doorbells was really noticeable, but I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised: they're excellent. The build quality of the hardware is excellent, it was easy to install. You need to mount it to a location that has 12VDC power (your existing doorbell). Connecting it to Wi-Fi was a breeze, but make sure that you have really good connectivity to your Wi-Fi access point; otherwise, the quality of video is probably going to suffer. I suspect that people who complain about image quality or latency are using a Wi-Fi access point located in the back of their houses; which is probably the worst case scenario for these kinds of devices. They use a lot of bandwidth when transmitting video. You install the Ring app on your smartphone. You get 30 days of free cloud storage. It's so cheap, spring for the yearly cloud storage package ($30). The app notifies you when somebody is at and rings the doorbell. You can review motion videos, and you can speak to the person at your door without having to open the door. Very useful when you're someplace else, or if you don't want to deal with solicitors. Excellent product so far, very pleased.

  This thing can not seem to regulate power to save its life. I have a brand new 16/30 transformer, all mechanical chimes bypassed, a Pro Power Kit v2 in Bypass, and it *still* slowly discharges over time. Now if I shut off the breaker and cold-boot, the mV’s jump up to over 4000 in a matter of minutes. But after that - the creeping drain sets in over several days. It seems every day it’s one step forward and two steps back with charging. It will gain a small amount of mV (maybe one or two), then it will lose several over night. But the amount of power it gains never surpasses the loss. I can always start the whole process over with a cold boot consistently.<br><br>Most likely I will exchange for another before the 30 days are up. But if it happens again I will move on to Nest Hello.

  I got the Ring Video Doorbell Pro as an upgrade for my SkyBell HD.  While the SkyBell does have color video recording in the evening - Ring Video Doorbell Pro does not.  The SkyBell does not have motion zones activation and recording. Any motion on the SkyBell and it starts recording everything from snow falling, the street lights flickering, cars passing by and so forth.  I was even more disappointed with my SkyBell would work intermittently then I knew it was time to end  the security service and the try out the Ring line of products and services.<br><br>The Ring DB Pro really hits the mark with what I was looking for and needed!

5.0 out of 5 stars,Initial impression: Excellent features + good tech support 24/7,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2018","<span>
  Gave Pro version to my daughter and son-in-law, who live upstairs in out two-flat, for Xmas. When I found time to install, it didn't work. Tech help patiently walked me through sensible troubleshooting steps and Helped me that the transformer in our 100+ year old building only put out 10-12 volts. (BTW, the output voltage is in the outside of almost all transformers so check that b4 ordering; brand doesn't matter.)  After a trip to the hardware store and installing a new $20 16V transformer, it still didn't work. The second tech guy talked me thru the same systematic troubleshooting and decided the unit was defective. He noticed it was purchased in late November and therefore past the return date for Amazon, so he arranged to mail a new one to me directly from Ring.<br><br>New one worked like a charm!  Installing using century old wiring is always tricky because the insulation deteriorates. The kit included simple connectors to replace the ends of the old wiring with new wiring.  Also included:  Masonry drill bit for mounting on concrete, brick or stucco; correctly sized Phillips screwdriver; and one extra of each screw or fastener so you aren't left in the lurch because one small connector went AWOL. Also included a cover plate for non-standard openings and 4 different colored plastic covers for the device. Can't remember the last time I installed a kit this complete!<br><br>Software install was simple thanks to included video tutorials inside app. Even switching between wifi in iOS and local wifi from device was one click. Use the built-in Device Health feature to verify that voltage and signal strength are both good, as I did, before trying to use it. So far, motion detection, live view and answering the doorbell have worked flawlessly. The video on the Pro is extremely clear, in color during the day and B&amp;W at night. There's some latency since the audio/video signals come over the net, but there isn't a monthly charge like a cell phone.<br><br>Time will tell how reliability works out and updates work out, but my first impression is very positive.  Ring seems to be a first class company who is here to stay.

  Installation was a breeze and packaging was very friendly.  It's nice that they include several different color plastic covers.  The cost of the cloud service is cheap.<br><br>Don't expect that this will have a good interface like a of the Nest products.  You can't watch the live view from a web browser, so if you're having issues with mobile data you can't if there isn't any motion detected... which is when it only starts recording; not as beneficial as 24/7 recording with notifications of motion.  That means that you often miss half of the action.  I've been having newspaper deliveries for over 6 months... the person comes well within the range of the camera, yet it's never recorded any motion.  If someone is fast, this thing will never see them.  But it does a great job of detecting moving leaves!  The resolution is fine, up close, but don't plan on using this for monitoring anything in your yard.<br><br>Pushing the button to ring the doorbell results in a 5 second delay, where your phone gets notified then the doorbell inside rings and the Ring acknowledges outside with a chime.  I don't really like the outdoor chime because it sounds really fake/cheap and immediately lets everyone know you have some tech.  I'd be fine without this ""feature"".  Without it, I don't think people would recognize that this is a camera (a positive).  I honestly have no idea why/how the interior mechanical chime can't immediately ring and THEN do all of the other stuff.<br><br>There's a lot left to be desired.  I bought this at $244.  It's not worth that.  Probably not worth $200.<br><br>UPDATE 1/16/19:  So, the app has changed a lot since my original review.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that the unit was so unreliable with connections that I instead upgraded to the Nest Hello.  It would regularly disconnect every few days, requiring me to reset it.  I put a meter on my power and found it was fine.  I was finally sick of having short little clips like where I'd watch a car pull into my driveway, the occupant sit in it for 45 seconds, the person get out, and then the clip would time out and save.  The 1 minute clips totally suck.  The Nest doesn't have the disconnect problems.  It also feels a lot more substantial and the video quality is substantially better.  Also, when you push the button, it actually chimes indoors right away.

  I specifically bought the “pro” model for the 1080p quality. I don’t know how they determine this quality. Faces are not even recognizable. Good WiFi connection. I even bought a WiFi extender to see if I could make it even stronger, but as the attached screenshots show, no way you’d recognize someone coming up to your door unless you already know them.<br><br>UPDATE: Ring support reached out to help with my problem. Most of my video quality issues were due to lighting. I used one of the included wedges to tilt the camera away from the wall and this adjustment seems to help some. Also, I was experiencing a buzzing sound from my doorbell, especially at night. Turns out you must connect two separate door bell buttons to two separate places on the doorbell chime. The instructions say to attach the ring doorbell adapter to ""Front"" and ""Trans"" but this assumes your doorbell is at the front door. If your doorbell isn't going at ""front"" you should connect it to the other terminal, probably labeled ""rear"".

  We've been very happy with our Ring video Doorbell Pro! Hubby installed it in about 15 minutes. I had to contact customer service at first because it wasn't showing hardly any options for me for controlling motion alerts and settings, etc.--be aware that whoever installs the doorbell, if they use the app on the phone they automatically become the main account controller (which wasn't going to work for us). After a quick call I got that sorted out, but no where in the FAQ or packaging does it tell you that. We haven't had any ""technical"" issues or bugs with it since... but it's been difficult to find the perfect balance of motion settings to alert us to cars in our driveway without alerting us to every car that drives by on the road. I've had to fiddle with the sensitivity settings and motions zones quite a bit, and it's still not perfect, but for the main areas (like front porch) it does a great job. I've been considering getting a 2nd one (or maybe the flood light) for the back yard, too.

5.0 out of 5 stars,One Month Use Review,15 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2016","<span>
  This review is based on the one month's use of the Ring Doorbell Pro. So far, myself and my wife (who is not a fan of this type of technology) love the product itself, the Ring customer service support I received, and the value of the Cloud recording option.<br><br>Installation:<br>Installation of the doorbell and the night vision module was very easy. This doorbell model requires that power (at least 16 volts) be supplied in order for it to work. My mechanical chime transformer was 16 volts so no issue there. Based on what I saw when researching, 16 volts appears the standard voltage. My first install step was to connect the night vision booster module to the transformer in my mechanical doorbell chime. It took only a few minutes to do this. The only issue I had was that I could not mount the module inside my plastic doorbell chime so that the plastic housing was flush against the wall. To solve this issue, I routed the module cable to the outside to the plastic housing and used the provided double sided tape to mount the module to plastic housing. Installation of the doorbell itself was done without issues.<br><br>App Setup:<br>Installing the app and going through the setup process went very smoothly. I connected to my wireless network, and then setup the motion zones I wanted to receive alerts from. I was very concerned with false positives because I have two tall arborvitaes flanking my front door. While you can setup a maximum of 4 zones, I only needed to configure two. The app allows you to receive optional notifications if someone rings your doorbell and/or motion is detected. What I really enjoy is that you can configure different sounds based on what occurs so you can know if someone rang your doorbell or if motion is detected. Each Ring device you add can be configured for a different sound.<br><br>Issues Encountered / Ring Customer Support:<br>The only issue I encountered was that my interior mechanical doorbell stopped ringing when the doorbell button was pressed. Ring's customer support staff is US-based and appears to genuinely want to help address your problem. To fix my problem they suggested switching the two wires connected to my doorbell. It has been working flawlessly ever since. Thanks Devante!<br><br>Cloud Recording Option:<br>The Ring Doorbell Pro includes 30 free days of cloud recording. While researching the various home monitoring solutions, cost of cloud recording was an important consideration for me. I found Ring's cloud recording cost ($3 per month or $30 annually) to be the best value for the money. While 'Live View' is definitely a nice feature, the ability to see what happened in the past is equally if not more valuable.<br><br>Mounting Concerns:<br>Mounting the doorbell was a big concern for me. As shown in the photos, I have aluminum siding and I needed to mount the doorbell so it pointed straight ahead. I purchased the Ring Pro Wedge Kit for $19 directly from Ring's website. The kit comes with three wedges and hardware which allow you to adjust the angle the camera points. Use one or all three wedges to achieve your desired camera angle. The wedges can be painted if desired.<br><br>Note: I was not compensated for this review. I purchased all items at full price.

  I purchased two Ring Pro doorbells. Setup and app are solid and work well. I also have the Ring door chime and that also works well. The installation kits and instructions are very good, with just about everything you need including mounting wedges and tools.<br><br>The biggest issues I've found is that the 2-way audio is very poor, almost unusable. It screeches, has static/feedback and is flat out painful to use. My power and internet speeds are fine, and the video is flawless. I've searched the internet and it seems many people have this problem. Based on what I've seen it seems to be a problem on the client side (especially a mobile phone) where the mic and speaker create feedback. Others suggested I try it with a headset and the audio is clear, so again I assume it's with the Ring client app and not the doorbell. I'm still happy with the doorbells but disappointed in the audio. If it's software then I hope Ting will address it in a future update.<br><br>So overall, great video doorbell but surprisingly poor/unusable 2-way audio.

  Decided to add some more home security, including the Ring Pro video doorbell.<br><br>Documentation and physical setup were simple. Hook Ring's power adapter device into your existing home doorbell chime unit, then replace the old door bell at your front door with the Ring, drill as needed, and screw into place along with a tiny torx ""security"" screw for the faceplate to deter theft. Only hitch was with the connectors meant to extend the doorbell wiring coming out of your front door area wall; I hadn't seen this particular type of connector before, turns out all you have to do is push stiff, bare wire firmly in so the spring-loaded connector can grab it and keep it snug. Specifics would've been nice to have in the instructions, but a quick google search revealed the solution so not a big deal. Ring support were easy to connect with via Twitter and email, and they were overall refreshingly responsive. The 30-day unconditional return policy and one-time free replacement in case of theft were quite reassuring. Also, on Ring's website they described an offer for a free solar-powered illuminated ""protected by Ring"" stop-sign shaped yard sign, a $45 item normally available for free if you purchase a Ring device directly through their website, but through their support team I got one of these free of charge after verifying my purchase.<br><br>Software features and setup were frustrating and disappointing. I dislike Apple, so my choices for controlling and monitoring the unit were either the Android or Windows 10 versions of the Ring app. Unfortunately, the Android devices of mine are a bit out of the ordinary; the smartphone I only rarely use and planned to dedicate to viewing the Ring's video is an old Samsung Galaxy S with a relatively recent version of the soon to be sunset Cyanogenmod ""flavor"" of Android, and my tablet is an Amazon Kindle Fire HDX with the latest updates, which Ring's founder James Siminoff informed me (upon connecting with me after I cc'd his email in contacting Ring Support, which was a pleasant surprise) that the Kindle devices are ""rough"" and not yet officially supported. Fair enough. Unfortunately I was never able to get the Ring app to open properly on either of my Android devices, so that left my only option as the Windows 10 app.<br><br>Shortly after upgrading to Windows 10, I disabled a lot of the annoying functionality that by default is enabled with it; Cortana (Microsoft's personal assistant), some games and other apps I would never, ever use, ever, and of course Microsoft Store. Whoops! Unfortunately for purposes of the Ring app, they are constrained by Microsoft's app architecture to have it run within an open instance of the Store, which to me is a really stupid idea (I come from a Microsoft .NET software development background though so I may be biased).<br><br>The Windows 10 app did at least function and enabled me to connect to the Ring Pro and configure it, though I had to do this from a laptop with wifi; unfortunately the app isn't smart enough to figure out that my wired desktop PC (connected to the very router that hosts my wifi) are on the same network, and so I couldn't use my desktop to set up the exclusively wifi-constrained Ring Pro. Once the initial configuration was out of the way, however, both my wife and I could access the Live View from our respective desktops through the Ring app.<br><br>In more ways than one the Ring Pro really is a ""black box""; configuration is done exclusively through the disappointingly anemic Ring app. You basically have two options for capturing video; subscribe to Ring's cloud-based video storage for around $30 annually, or nothing; no local storage option is available. Unlike most mainstream (and much cheaper) wireless IP security cameras, you can't even capture snapshots with the Ring and say email them; at least, not without something like IFTTT which offers a handful of ""applets"" (some of which are works in progress) that enable some primitive email functionality and smart device interaction not provided natively by the Ring Pro.<br><br>Once installed and set up on my network, the Ring Pro's visual quality was very good, day and night. I did end up purchasing their ~$25 plastic ""wedge"" adapter to angle the device so it could monitor more of my front door area. The real deal breaker unfortunately wasn't the Ring app despite its anemic features and limited usability, but the unit's bandwidth requirements.<br><br>The Ring Pro seems geared toward users who've invested more than I have in broadband. My ""old school"" DSL connection gets 6 mbps down and a paltry 384 kbps up, while the Ring Pro demands at minimum 2 mbps up. I thought I could live with this until it became clear there were no options other than cloud storage for purposes of retaining video, and that is a dealbreaker; at minimum I wanted to be able to email snapshots of someone at my door (not simply so I would be notified, but also so in case someone got past my front door and my pack of dogs and swiped my computer, I'd still have evidence available offsite to hand off to the police after the fact). Ideally I wanted to be able to redirect the Ring's footage to say an NAS or even just my desktop PC on my wifi. Nope.<br><br>Worse, the audio never worked properly for me; when someone pushes the doorbell you're supposed to be able to interact with them live, even from a smartphone, basically from whatever device you're running the Ring app, but in my testing with three PCs with functional headsets, no audio interaction was possible. In the Live Video mode, a wind chime just outside my front door on a breezy day only registered the occasional, very faint ""tinkle"". Ring support suggested upgrading my broadband, which definitely is doable, just not desirable; $30 annually to support the Ring Pro uploading data to its cloud service would quickly be eclipsed by my much higher bandwidth costs, and being stuck working with a cable provider who has a home on my own personal service provider blacklist (looking at you, COX Communications).<br><br>If I were say retired and not working full-time I might've opted to improvise some DIY solution, like write software to capture the live video and copy it automagically to one of my computers on my network, and similarly fire off emails with snapshots attached, much like many relatively inexpensive IP cameras let you do through their web-based firmware.<br><br>Ring support, to their credit, was responsive, and even offered to set an appointment for their tier 2 folks to walk me through troubleshooting. I considered this but later declined; previous interactions with them made clear the Ring Pro needs more upload bandwidth than I have, and with the meager functionality of the Windows 10 version of the Ring app as my only interface to it, it seemed like way too much effort for something that really should've worked out of the box AND provided a local fallback option for storing snapshots and video.<br><br>I knew what I was getting into before buying the Ring Pro. I did my homework, I figured well, surely if one version of the app doesn't quite work, the other will, but my hopes were dashed in actually using it, both in terms of the app's limited functionality for what it does provide, and the features it doesn't provide at all.<br><br>The concept of the Ring is brilliant as reflected by the ease of installation, and in taking a widespread standard that is household doorbell wiring and repurposing it to power a smart device that lets your regular doorbell chime pass through and SO much more in addition. The implementation in my case, unfortunately, was not a viable solution for my home security needs. I'm next planning to try a cheaper competitor's version that actually seems to offer some of the more familiar wireless IP camera features I'm familiar with, my review on that will reflect my experience.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Installed 2 Ring Video Doorbell pros: Required manual fix for night vision,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2019","<span>
  One installation was super easy. The system worked out of the box. The mechanical door bell chimes were compatible, the door bell transformer was 22V 30VA, the night vision worked OK. On that system I would have given a 5.<br><br>The other system was more challenging. My existing door bell chimes were not on the approved list, so I had to replace them. My 16V 10VA transformer was too small, so I had to replace that with a 16V 30VA transformer. After a few days of troubleshooting, the unit was declared defective after a one hour support call, so they sent me a new unit (different packaging from my 1st unit). After installation of the 2nd unit, I had to wait 5 hours for the device to properly charge. Eventually, it allowed me to perform setup and it worked OK during daylight but night vision was almost all black (see photo).<br><br>The root cause of the black images at night was that the internal IR LEDs on the device were reflecting too strong off the side of the wall causing image saturation. To prevent this problem, I covered the bottom half of the Ring Video Doorbell pro with black tape to block the internal IR LEDs which act as a ""flashlight"" from the device to illuminate the background. With the IR LEDs blacked out, I was able to prevent the very bright reflection that was causing the night vision problem.  With this configuration, the porch light which is always on at night provides sufficient illumination for night vision to work properly. I will give this second unit a 1 or a 2 for all the setup trouble.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice upgrade from old 1st Gen Ring, but a bit fussy about current",One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2018","<span>
  Sleeker model without the bulky battery of the old 1st gen model. However, unlike the 1st gen and newer Ring 2 (that has a battery) the Pro is rather fussy about power. It requires a minimum of a 20VA doorbell transformer. Most transformers are 10VA so you'll likely have to buy a replacement.<br><br>Another issue that's not mentioned clearly in the manual is that although the Pro doesn't have a battery, it does have a capacitor that acts as a short term battery (I assume so that if someone cuts the wires it can still broadcast a few more minutes to catch someone in the act). Because of this, the Pro will usually NOT light up right away when you connect it and you may assume that the unit is dead (I did and promptly disconnected it). Depending on how discharged the capacitor is, and the size of your transformer, it may take several minutes after connecting the wires, before the capacitor charges up and the light comes on. In my case it took almost 10 minutes (granted I was using a 10VA transformer at that time).<br><br>I would recommend Ring updates the manual to clarify the requirement that the unit may need to charge for a few minutes before coming alive.

5.0 out of 5 stars,A LOT of notifications,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2020","<span>
  I bought this for my parents for Father's day- to add extra security to the house. It is a very well-made doorbell and takes 10 minutes to install. I watched a youtube video beforehand so what I knew what I was doing. I had a lot of issue with this doorbell because it would go off every time a car would drive by but I realized that you can change the motion window to only go off over certain areas. It is very responsive to motion and you can change the sensitivity. The camera is great and also has really good night vision. My only complaint is that the doorbell did disconnect from the wifi shortly after installing it and it didn't give any warning of this happening; however, it reconnected on its own and this hasn't happened yet (to our knowing). Overall a great product.

  I really wanted to like this product and wish I could write a good review. I really just wanted decent performance that I could count on. But sadly -- after having a ring door bell pro, a stick up battery and a chime pro for about five months -- the bottom line is they just don't work properly at least half the time. I'd give the overall performance C-. We have good wifi and I'd rank myself above average in tech savvy. Maybe if I wanted to spend hours with customer service I might get incrementally better performance, but I just don't feel i should have to do that. This is just a middling product that oversells itself. i wish i could return it.<br><br>Two things I want to add to this review now, Dec. 2019. I really appreciate the effort Ring customer service put into reaching me and helping with my issues. Although we never really connected, I feel the product has been working better lately sometimes and sometimes it just totally buffers. So let's make this review 2.5 stars now.

  Well, it took 20 hours to power on (yes, I said 20 HOURS). But after it finally turned on,it works great and I like it. Setup is easy, I had to swap out my existing transformer for a 16 volt 30 W transformer that supplies enough power for the Ring Pro. I had the unit installed in about an hour, but when I turned on the circuit breaker for the transformer, nothing happened at the doorbell (no lights, no sound, no nothing), I was furious, I called tech support and they were OK to deal with. Did some research online and found that this is a common issue with the Ring Pros due to the fact that there is a small battery in the unit that has to charge for the first time and being that I'm in MN and its cold here that could take some extra time. It finally powered on after 20 hours of it being installed and power applied to it. I don't usually leave reviews, but I thought this is something future buyers should be aware of and maybe it will help someone not freak out like i did.<br><br>After it finally powered on, I finished the setup on the app and stared to play with it. It is a nice app that is easy to use.

  The reviews were pretty good and I was confident in the product because friends have had theirs for a while and showed me how it all works. Unfortunately I didn't know our voltage was too low so I got the wrong one first, installed it and it wouldn't work, so realized I had to the battery version route.<br>They gave me a full refund and easy return instructions, so WHEW!<br>Once I got the correct one in it was instantly done. Happy with everything, although the motions sensor can be a bit sensitive. I had to change the motion indicator tone on my phone because it was going off so much and I needed a quieter notification. No biggie. I've adjusted the motion range a couple of times and for the most part it only goes off when a motion is truly at the door. We have on occasion still had a false motion notification when a large truck goes down our street, but for the most part.<br>Also, the battery pack. I haven't had to charge it yet. The instructions say it will blink RED when the battery is due to be charged. I've had it in now for almost three months and nothing yet. It sounds like once it indicates it needs a charge that it will only take a few hours to charge. Again, no biggie.<br>We're pretty happy with the Ring so far, and it's kind of cool to see the comings and goings, and that extra security is a great feeling to say the least.

  Review updated 02/13/2020<br><br>At first, I thought this was a great product. Lately, the product has been shutting itself off and rebooting itself randomly. After talking with customer service, I was adviced to *purchase a new Ring doorbell*. The device is defective, yet I have to pay for a replacement. Forget Ring. I'm replacing all of my Ring devices. They don't last as long as the others (Arlo, Google Nest, etc). I don't mind paying if I've messed up the device, or if there's an upgraded device, but this device has been shielded from the weather because it's on a covered front porch. It should not be failing, but it is. I'm not paying this much to replace a product that fails in this short amount of time. Save your money, buy something else!

  We really like the doorbell. It gives us great peace of mind. It's great for knowing when kids come home as well as when people drop off items on your porch. We have an Owner and a User on the account and I like that both of us get notifications and can correspond with the visitor simultaneously, even when we are not at the same location.<br><br>My biggest complaint is the app is slow to load the image when motion is at the door, so I hope this is improved. Also, it would be nice to allow users to modify some of their own settings  as well as manage their own stored recordings. Perhaps an added user level between Owner and User could allow this? Another option that would be nice would be an override for the Do Not Disturb function on the iphone. While I do not want to hear dings for emails, calls, texts, and Facebook messages while sleeping at night, this  option also turns off sound for the Ring app. Not sure how much can be done about this on Ring's side, but if someone is at my door while I'm sleeping, I want to know.  Maybe allowing motion sensor alerts to be heard through the Ring the chime accessory?

  The firm had excellent customer service. However the item has a few flaws or considerations you must make before purchasing the item. For example, its location. Where I had to place the Ring all was able to view was a vague profile of a person standing at my door and if your door is in alcove, all you may see is a vague infrared image of an object and a washed out back ground.  The other is for an additional fee, you have to subscribe to a cloud account to maintain recordings of activity at your door.  The installation instruction enclosed with the Ring are not very good. Suggest using the better on line version.  It probably works fine, if you have large porch  or your door is on the street or side walk where both the porch and door where there is unobstructed ambient daylight.

  When the app reports motion, and I try to use ""live view"", it will most often say ""live view terminated"" or else give me the spinning circle of NO.<br>Actual physical doorbell rings only show up in the timeline 50% of the time, often *hours* later.<br><br>Even though I've tuned the parameters, the lights of a car that happen to cross our porch will trigger a false positive. We had to take our flag down because its shadow would trigger a false positive when there was any breeze that caused it to move.<br>Yet there are times when the mailman comes--the Ring is right near the mailbox, pointed slightly out--and there is no notification event.<br><br>All of this makes it anxiety producer, rather than a peace of mind one.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"2 Ring Pro's are up and Running for me, I share my notes and ideas for improvement",One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2017","<span>
  Seems like a lot of problems I read about in other reviews boil down to using older power supplies or weak internet. This device is working solidly now using my  Netgear Orbi router and several iPhones, Win10, and hopefully soon to be my new Echo Show (as of early July the Echo Show is mostly useless as it takes a long time to link to the video and there is no 2-way voice communication via that promising Amazon Echo device. Until Amazon and Ring get their acts together the iPhone method will have to do though I was hoping my Amazon Echo with Alexa would be a faster way to answer if my phone is not nearby.<br><br>I share my installation notes that helped me get through a few small problems initially:<br>1. skipped all old chime hardware and wired directly with a new ELK 24VAC transformer as recommended by Ring. Older houses often have weak transformers and the old chimes draw a lot of power themselves. For in-house chime it was optimal for me to purchase the Ring Chime plug-in unit and bi-pass that old mechanical bell equipment with a straight wire to the door (finding the original transformer is the trick with this approach though so may be tough for some).<br>2. My Netgear Orbi system was initially part of a problem I initially believed to be with Ring but I think it is just that Orbii is itself a new product and needs some time to improve with firmware. For the benefit of others struggling to get a strong RSSI signal strength with Orbi even when it is close enough that it should be a perfect signal. I kept finding my signal would start off strong at about -55db but over an hour or so would drop back to a not so great -70db despite my Orbi being nearby the Ring units. I was puzzled but came across an internet discussion that hinted that Orbi had problems with Nest cams also when the Orbi advance feature of beam forming was active. As soon as I disabled beam forming my Ring Pro Wi-Fi signal stabilized at a good level and the video choppieness, audio drop outs, and other periodic unreliability all disappeared. I am hopeful my Orbi beam forming issues will resolve with future firmware updates but until then, I figured out my fix here. Note that Orbi units today seem to come pre-configured with beam forming off but if you are a techy, like me, who enabled it to help connect other devices more optimally, you may need to revert for both this and for Nest cameras at present.<br><br>I tried telephone customer support as I needed the Pro Power Cable (effectively an inline fuse) since I was wiring direct to a transformer). The call was answered domestically and the agent was prompt and courteous in both cases when I installed 2 Ring Pro units.<br><br>Things Ring still needs to fix to get this to a 5-star rating for me:<br>1. The process of answering via iPhone needs more streamlining for speed to answer.  I’d like an option to allow the app to go straight into conversation mode when I click on the notification as the present model of clicking that notification, entering your iPhone passcode or fingerprint, combined with a need to click the answer button in the app to start talking means nearly 25 seconds pass meaning some leave the door before I can answer.<br>2. The Amazon Echo Show integration is horrible at present. To be fair, this Amazon and Ring partnership is new and holds promise to improve (hopefully soon). The time it takes to load the doorbell with all the buffering (20 seconds or more even with my 50 down and 12 up bandwidth) plus there is no two-way voice communication at present meaning my Amazon Show is effectively unusable with this Ring Pro at this time.<br>3. The regular old Amazon Echo’s should be made to work with this system – of course the video would be skipped with them but you should be able to voice link to the front door to answer a call nonetheless.<br>4. I’d like the ability to customize the ring tones for the two different doorbells I have. The Garage camera should sound different than the front door but I cannot seem to change the sounds using the iPhone app at present.<br>5. Many have complained about the monthly video feed charges. I am not too deeply concerned here as long-term these companies will need a revenue stream from users who want the video recording in order to stay solvent. Yes, I’d like to store the video myself but I can only imagine the challenges Ring would experience trying to support many trying to save money by using local storage options. I hope ring will come up with a plan to help reduce my monthly costs for 2 or 3 devices as I have now (their consolidated plan becomes relevant at 4 or more devices). I’d rather pay the $30 annually (in my case $60 for 2 devices) and have the company stay financially viable with their video services rather than get something that becomes insolvent in a couple years with no revenue stream. Perhaps a plan where 2 devices could be registered for the $30 annually but get less video retention time?<br>6. I’ll need to wait a few more weeks to ensure this system remains stable as it appears to be now. This video connectivity holds great promise but early adopters need to go into it with a sense of adventure and willingness to work with the company as they work toward making things better.<br>In closing, this is a nice unit that requires a few things to be setup right at home, a sense of adventure as with all new tech products, and hope/optimism that Ring and their partners will keep innovating to make a good product better over time.

  I had my Amazon package stolen a few months back so I decided to get the Ring Video Doorbell 2.  That model has an option to go with battery or wired.  The Pro version doesn't give you a battery option and when we installed it via existing doorbell wires, turns out that it wasn't enough power.  Made installation a little longer but it wasn't something that was hard to fix.<br><br>Ones that issue with the wiring was worked out and we were able to see video, I can definitely tell the camera resolution is way superior than the version I got.  Also, you have more flexibility with setting the motion area on the Pro version the 2 that I have.<br><br>In conclusion, for $50 more the Pro version is a good upgrade from the Ring 2.  I suggest not messing with batteries and hard wire the Ring.  You get better resolution, better motion setting (especially if you're facing a busy street), and slimmer style that is aesthetically more appealing in front of the house.

  I've been wanting to purchase this device for over a year and have been watching pricing until it went on sale for $200.00- finally pulled the trigger! I'll say it was much easier to install then I would have thought, only took about 15 minutes start to finish and I'm tediously detailed when doing something like this to make sure I do it right (in other words a bit OCD!).<br>The product works amazingly well on all aspects. I was concerned about a fairly busy road in front of my home setting off the motion, but the customizable motion zone is awesome! was able to make it fit my front yard perfectly. The video quality is excellent, when I zoom in on my neighbor across the street the details are impressive. And on another note, the speed of alerts is terrific! I tested walking at a normal pace to my front door and didn't make it there before my phone alert told me there was motion. The audio quality is great as well.<br>I would have gone 5 stars but the price is a bit steep along with requiring a fee for monitoring.<br>I live in MN and will update this after winter if there are any new findings or problems.<br>March 29th 2019 update- This company is awesome! I've updated my rating to 5 stars due to recent activity. My product was purchased in June of 2017, and early in March it failed... it survived the -30 arctic vortex but had something fail after... I didn't even consider contacting the company as my warranty was well past void but a local contact suggests I try anyway, and much to my surprise when I called Ring there was zero hesitation in shipping me a replacement unit! including postage paid return for the old unit. I received it within about 3 business days and after literally 5 minutes had it installed and working! Back in action!!!<br>The peace of mind I get with security for my home and knowing when my packages arrive are well worth the cost. I've been able to quickly get resolution on 2 separate shipments over the last 18 months that were delivered to the wrong address. you know how that normally goes, you call the shipping company and they tell you its delivered... simply saying ""I have video proof its not on my doorstep"" has worked terrific in them immediately investigating where it was, and in one case the delivery driver was able to retrieve it and still get it to my that day! If it wasn't for this device it would have taken longer on both occasions. I will never own a home without one.<br>Hope this review helps!

I boxed it up and sent it back to Amazon (thank you Amazon!) for a replacement. While waiting for the replacement I purchased and installed a new doorbell transformer (just in case mine was bad). I now have 24v to the front door. Connected the new doorbell pro and..... DOA. Nothing I tried would put this thing into setup mode. Let is set connected over night and still nothing.

  This product couldn't have been any easier to install! Well, it could have been installed for me, but was't necessary.  ( They actually offer that though! )  I am very impressed with the features of the Ring Doorbell Pro. The motion sensing captures motion over 50 from the door. The ability to set up multiple zones to be monitored for motion is perfect.  I have added my WINK hub to the Ring App. This allows me to create robots to trigger events on a doorbell ring.  I have it set to trigger turning on a couple lights when it rings. Pretty convenient.  The video quality is pretty good. I get an occasional stutter on cloud playback, but that might be my internet connection. If I had anything to complain about, it would be the quality of the camera itself. I see a lot of video bleed where it's high contrast. ( I included a screen cap ) I hope that can be tweaked with firmware updates.<br>I have been VERY impressed with customer service.  My Ring doorbell is next to a wall, so the angle isn't very helpful. I emailed them, to ask if I would be able to move the camera a bit, from inside the device. Instead, they have sent me a corner adapter to help with that. FREE. ( It is on the way)<br><br>I would recommend this to anyone wanting to be able to monitor their porches and be able to talk, in near real time, back and forth with visitors.

There is a gap where they walked up to the camera and robbed me which would perfect for the police but ring failed on me for not recording the entire event. After spending the large amount for the camera and for the subscription it has failed me and im out hundres of dollars of stolen items now. Ring needs to fix the recording and record the entire events instead of a time frame.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Ring but Bad Connection,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2019","<span>
  I absolutely love the idea of being able to check in on my home and see the activity around it. When the Ring connects to the internet, it does the job, but I've experienced intermittent internet connectivity issues since I've had it. It was professionally installed, so I don't think the problem is with installation. I've checked my internet connection and when it connects, the signal is strong. This has me leaning towards it being an issue with the quality of the Ring device. I know there may be better cameras out there after reading reviews prior to purchase, but the Ring offered the best communication with neighbors option, which I thought would be invaluable. Being able to share footage with neighbors seamlessly was very appealing, but I guess you can't share video if you don't have video.  I really hate intermittent functionality, so I can't give this device high ratings. I'm also not liking the prospect of having to pay to get a different camera installed.

  It took me quite a while to get this working properly, but the problem was on my end, not on Ring's end.  Wiring and installation went very smoothly.  When trying to link up with the Ring servers, it kept timing out.  I use OpenDNS for my local router and my router was set up to block all DNS traffic to non-OpenDNS servers.  Once I turned that off, registration went very smoothly.  Support was great.  Every now and then the image pixelates.  I'm not sure if that is a WIFI issue or an issue with the bandwidth on my phone.<br><br>I had one other issue, and support was great also.  I had intermittent issues with the mechanical doorbell chime not working.  It appears when the issue was happening, the voltage to the doorbell was dropping just below 4 mv.  They sent me a new power pack and an external ringer to plug in at no charge to me.<br><br>I don't like the monthly charge (and am hoping it gets wrapped up in Prime).  I am also hoping they expand the interface with Alexa.  I have a Show in the kitchen.  It would be nice if the camera showed up automatically when their was either motion or a doorbell ring (configurable).<br><br>Overall, I am very happy with the end result.

  I consider myself a fairly ""handy"" person.  Ive installed a NEST and a Rachio sprinkler ""smart"" controller but i found this product to be the most frustrating of all the smart devices I've bought for my home.  Ill never know if the ""pro"" is as good as people say it is because after I installed it properly, and spending ""hours"" on the phone with installation support, and my power company, i found out that my home and my manual doorbell do not support the power requirements of the Pro. Sure... there are legal disclaimers that mention needing ""hardwire"" (which i had) but i only say the minimum 16v requirement way after installing the product and reading the fine print.  Bottom line is that unless you have a 16v ""transformer"" in your house (good luck finding that), this device will not work.  Ive ordered the Ring 2 since apparently it doesn't require the 16v, but can live with the 10v my doorbell and transformer can support.  But... disappointing that i won't get the most recent product.  If you do have below a 16v transformer in your home, you will need to upgrade that transformer and possibly your doorbell so that it doesn't get ""fried"".  Im kind of curious how many peoples homes actually will support this ring pro, since my home was recently built and is relatively new, yet doesn't support this model.  I also am often annoyed at reviews that say ""i don't like this product because i had to install it""... those are silly, but i thought it was worth mentioning my experience because most people are not electricians and do not know the voltage of their transformers, nor could they find it.  So, the product becomes ""unusable"", despite the disclaimer.  Anyway, hope this helps.  Don't buy this product until you know your transformers voltage.  Hopefully the Ring 2 will work as the company says it will.

  This is the best gadget we purchased in the last year.  It works just as advertised. You get a notification on your phone each time someone enters the area you design as well as a ring when the doorbell is used.  The nice thing is that you can designate the area you want Ring to watch. As I would assume with most people, we do not extend our area out to the sidewalk or street or it would be going off much too often.<br><br>Very easy to install, directions were easy to follow.  We already had a doorbell so we used the Ring to replace it. The video is clear,, even at night.  And the voice control works fine also. We do get some animal (cats, squirrels) that set it off but you can make it less sensitive.  Your choice on the sensitivity and the area it covers.<br><br>I highly recommend this product to give a better sense of what is going on around your house, whether you are home or not.

  Overall, this is an excellent product that's well-designed and executed.  Some comments:<br>- Very good packaging and design; providing four faceplates is a nice touch that should work for most decors.<br>- Instructions in the pamphlet and video are very good.  Tying the video doorbell to existing wiring is a real engineering feat and makes the entire installation SO much better than anything requiring either new wiring or rechargeable batteries.<br>- The field of view is very wide; this is good for seeing people near the door (what this is designed to do), but it's not good for seeing details at the street (see image).<br>- Image clarity at night is lacking.<br>- Being able to define different zones for monitoring is an interesting idea, but somewhat half-baked and not terribly useful from what I can tell.<br>- The price for cloud storage (only $3/month) is unbeatable among competitors.<br>- When first installed, I often saw lags of several seconds (or more) in the recorded videos.  I contacted customer support, which was very helpful.  They found the RSSI (network strength) at the Doorbell measured around 65, which is fairly low.  (My wifi router is in the basement.)  So they sent me a free Chime Pro with WiFi extender, worth $49 (

Its instructions did not make this clear at all, but you need to go through the setup process on the Doorbell AFTER installing the Chime Pro in order to take advantage of its WiFi extension capabilities.  After doing so, the RSSI dropped to 50 (much stronger signal).  Although the video lags seem better now, they are by no means completely gone.  Adding the Chime Pro also allows for custom doorbell chimes, and they fire much quicker than my mechanical doorbell.

  Set up was straightforward, just followed the directions. By the way, who decided it was a good idea to write instructions in white text on a light gray background?  They were hard to read. Set up went smoothly except that, after initially working as advertised for a minute or two, it stopped working.  Only indication was a flashing white light on the doorbell in the 9:00 to 12:00 segment of the light ring around the doorbell.  Although the instructions included a page showing what various indicators meant, this particular indication was not included.  Tried various troubleshooting as suggested by the app but nothing worked. Called customer service who told me the problem was probably my transformer.  After reading other reviews, concluded that it may have started to upload software and that is apparently what happened because after an hour or so, the system worked again and continues to work after at least 48 hours.  By the way, in the health section of the app, my transformer voltage is listed in green text which I assume means it's within tolerance.  Otherwise, it should bein amber or red text.

  Let me tell you a story.<br><br>I love gadgets. I bought my ring pro after having done exhaustive research looking for the best Video doorbell option available on the market today.<br><br>The install process is relatively simple. Remove the old doorbell, connect the two leads to your new ring doorbell then connect to your wifi. Install the retrofit kit on your old bell and done. Mine worked great the night I installed it.<br><br>Unfortunately, when I tried to show a buddy at work the next morning it wouldn't access the Live View and tells me, the Ring doorbell has disconnected from my wifi. OK, no big deal, press the ""reconnect"" button. It tells me that I need to be in close proximity to reconnect. What the hell? WHY?<br><br>Ok fine. So after work, I try to reconnect. Oh no, you need to remove the security screw and faceplate, then press the ""setup"" button hidden underneath. OK, so I do that. That doesn't reconnect to my wifi... it restarts the setup like starting with a new device. I try to go through the setup but now the Ring doorbell no longer broadcasts its ad-hoc connection (required to provide the device with your home network name and password). So it's permanently disconnected from my wifi. I tried rebooting... I tried a hard reset... no luck with anything. It still rings my doorbell but that's about it and now it's super hot.<br><br>I call Ring's tech support. After troubleshooting through the same steps I just did on my own, we conclude that it's defective. The tech support agent apologizes and says he's going to expedite a replacement to me. It's a Monday night, he swears I'll have it in my hands by Weds. Weds comes and goes, no replacement. Thursday night I call support again, a get a new agent that apologizes and tells me that it looks like the prior agent dropped the ball and didn't expedite it, but I'll have it on Friday. Friday comes and goes, nada. So I call again on Saturday, where I'm told that it sounds like the last two agents I spoke to just made up delivery dates because they didn't know. So this agent gives me a tracking number showing that it hadn't even been shipped until Thursday and won't arrive until next weds.<br><br>I could have contacted Amazon, filed the return, gotten a refund and reordered and received a replacement in less time than it took these people to drop an EXPEDITED replacement into the mail.<br><br>AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!<br><br>Some strange things to note though, while a $2 doorbell controls your normal built-in bell by itself, the folks at Ring seem to have done a marvelous job of over-complicating. In order for your built-in doorbell to function, you will need to wire in their 'retrofit kit' because, without it, your doorbell will not function. If you're the meticulous OCD type, be aware that there's about a 1-2 sec lag for the bell to ring after the button is pressed.<br><br>I'm still waiting for the replacement to come.<br>-----------------------<br>UPDATE:<br><br>After my initial review, I was contacted by a Sr Manager on the Ring support team who apologized for the experience and told me to return the defective hardware to Amazon to get my money back and to keep the replacement sent by Ring support as a courtesy for the poor service experience. Since then their support has been pretty good with one exception - after telling me to return the defective unit to Amazon, they sent me two automated emails telling me to remember to make sure I send them back the defective hardware else be charged full retail. It's just an automated message, but I didn't appreciate it after they had given me other instructions or that it took 2 of these emails before they caught it and fixed it.<br><br>So far, I haven't had any issues with the replacement. The only recommendation I would have to prospective buyers is to make sure their wifi signal is reasonably strong where they'd like to install their ring.

  As an owner of the Ring Doorbell for quite some time, I decided to upgrade to the Pro. I am disappointed. Maybe it's me, but I can't tell that much of a difference in the quality of the image I get from the Pro. But what I think is a lame attitude from Ring is the fact that they now force you to subscribe to their cloud services (not advertised, so be careful!), otherwise you can't have the events recorded - I had never seen such requirement for my original Doorbell! And what is the option? None! One can't set up a ""server"" on the phone or a computer to record the events. You either pay Ring or you don't get any recording. Oh, it is just $30/yr. But Ring is forcing its customers, after charging about $250 for the unit, to buy the recording service. How lame! Not to mention that the time it takes for the unit to contact the ""mother ship"" is too long, so sometimes whomever was ringing the doorbell has already left. I regret wasting my money with this product, do not recommend anyone buying any more of their gadgets because they want you to pay for monitoring.

  Overall, this is a great product, and I love having the ability to see who's at my door and interact with them from anywhere.  Getting a stable connection was a bit tricky.  I have a wireless network that is 5 and 2.4 with the same SSID, letting the device choose which band to run on.  Initially, I let the Ring select which band it wanted (the access point is on the other side of the wall from where the doorbell is, so distance/interference is not an issue).  After noticing that the connection would frequently drop and not automatically reconnect, I decided to create a new, isolated 2.4GHz SSID which was for the doorbell only.  The performance and reliability has been solid since I moved the device to the isolated 2.4GHz band only.  This may be more of a challenge for those with the most basic knowledge of wireless networks.<br><br>The cloud service is also worth it!  Being able to go back and check motion alerts is great.

  The doorbell portion of my Ring pro worked sporadically after about a month. Customer service sent me a new transformer, and that made no difference.  After a couple of months, I finally got a replacement doorbell. It worked fine for a few months. Then it gradually got worse as time went by. Sometimes pressing the doorbell it would ring, sometimes not.  Now, after about a year and a half, it is rare for the doorbell to ring when pressed. We rely on the motion detector to know if someone is out front. The motion detector and camera has always worked well. I would point out that the doorbell is mounted in a covered entrance way. It's out of the sun, and only gets rained on when there is a very windy storm. I am very disappointed in the doorbell.

  My old doorbell was installed by the builder. It worked but you could only hear the chime if you were in the right room. And of course you had no idea who was at the door unless you opened it. And if I wasn’t at home… well tough luck. The Ring Video Doorbell Pro solved these problems.<br>First, I replaced the old chime with an outlet and plugged in a Ring Chime. Then I put Ring Chimes in the master bathroom and in the garage. This allows me to be alerted whenever someone presses the doorbell. Since Ring also dings my iPhone and Apple Watch I am doubly alerted. Did I mention the joy of being able to see the visiter and talk to them on my phone, even when I’m not in the house. Luxury. It even warns me when someone is approaching the door.<br>The install was easy. I uninstalled the doorbell and the old chime. The chime had a built-in 12 v power supply and was connected to the house wiring. I replaced it with an outlet to use with a Ring Chime. I then rerouted the bell wire to a Ring 24 volt Transformer.<br>Next, I installed the Ring Doorbell. Because my bell was positioned to the side of the door I had ordered an Angle (20/30/40 Degree) Adjustment Adapter Mounting Plate Bracket Wedge Kit. I used its 40 degree bracket. This also gave me some extra room for the bell wire.<br>Everything fit perfectly, the app is easy to set up and use and I am a happy camper. The app held my hand throughout the install and connecting to my WiFi. The video is sharp and clear (although the night vision isn’t as crisp.)<br>Perhaps some luck here, but also a great and well engineered product.

  It’s great! It was very easy to install and set up. Our house was build 2008 and the chime and doorbell button were completely compatible.

Would be handy if you have steep stairs leading to your door. Overall I’m very very happy. I can see what’s going on in the front yard and it gives a nice windchime sound to my phone when detecting motion. It’s easy to change motion spaces. You can really fine tune the motion zone. I was hesitant with a lot of the reviews saying they had issues but I think if you have good WiFi and and minimal tech skills order it and if doesn’t work you can always send it back. But.

  I purchased the Skybell initially because of the free cloud and had nothing but issues.  Customer service was not great as the finger was always pointed at my network.  I have AT&amp;T Fiber and a professionally setup Peplink Router and 3 Access Points with 650 mbps throughput, one of the access points is 10 feet from the doorbell location.  So I gave up, sent back the Skybell and went with Ring Pro.  Install was a snap and it's worked great... so much for my network being the problem.  The only complaint I have so far is on 2 of the 10 ring notifications I have received thus far, the person is already gone by the time it notifies me and I answer.  I checked with both people (appointments I had scheduled), and they waited a minute or longer so there had to be a delay at the ring servers.  I hope this improves over time.<br><br>Update: 05-19-2017<br><br>While the app, install and basic function are great, I decided to drop my rating to 2 stars after long-time use for three reasons:<br><br>1.  I have a professional wireless system and all of my devices wotk flawlessly in and outside of the house, but even though it is 15 feet from one of my Access Points, still the Ring Pro is often sketchy.  I would say about 30% of the time someone rings the doorbell, I get the notification, I click on it... by the time the live video loads they are walking away.  Other times it seems pretty quick to load.  This is true even if I am in the house on the same network, so it's not my LTE connection.  I am assuming since my wifi system monitors drops in thruput and I've had no issues logged at these times that they occasionally have bottleneckss on their end.  Not acceptable for a ""pro"" version with paid account.<br><br>2.  This one really burns me.  Even my daughters toy-like off brand $75 digital camera has spot or center weighted evaluative metering.  During the daytime, unless it's really overcast... you cannot make out the person standing in front of it as they are mere silhouettes.  (See photo.)  Their mission is to reduce crime.  And their ads all focus on easy ID'ing of the criminal.  Think you could pick the guy in my photo out of a lineup?  If you pay attention, all of their ads are on overcast days or installs where the doorbell is mounted on a sidewall with nothing bright in the background.  This thing cannot resolve to prioritize it's exposure for the one thing it is intended for, the subject standing in front of it.  A simple firmware enhancement allowing a slot meter setting whereas the exposure algorithm uses the sensors center arrays to better establish exposre for backlit situation would fix it.<br><br>3. To continue on point 2, I have voiced these concerns to Ring for months.  Every time I get the same response... ""We completely understand your concerns and will make sure we get this over with our Dev team. We appreciate your patience and know that we are working to improve our product line.""  Well, the screen grab of video I am attaching was taken yesterday so I assume working to improve the product means some other product they will want me to upgrade to because they are not doing anything to fix the issue.<br><br>Bottom line... it appears they still have bottlenecks in their servers affecting performance.  And, if you have a porch with an overhang, like 90% of the homes out there... forget getting anything but a dark outline figure when the sun is out.

Refund here I come.<br><br>ORIGINAL MESSAGE: I bought the Ring Video Doorbell Pro late in April 2018 for over $200. The only installation instructions in the box were in a foreign language. I'm not sure based on this fact that the device was usable with our electrical current. I called Ring to explain the problem and asked if I even got the American version of the device, which they said was not an issue because it will install in Europe and the United States the same (not sure I'm buying this, but that could be the case). They POLITELY declined to provide me with the 3 original documents in English, for which I paid for when I bought it. I want to stress that Ring's customer service was nothing but polite but couldn't seem to manage the simple task of taking 3 small booklets from their office exemplars or requesting them from their fulfillment department and mailing them out to me. Ring's service frustrated and disappointed me in terms of their unwillingness to fix a simple issue. I want to tell Ring's customer relations that being nice and being polite is a great thing, which all parties including myself were, but initiative and effectiveness are just as important.

  I'm pretty technical and it took about 3 hours of effort; multiple calls to Ring customer service; and a replacement to get this working. It feels like a first-generation product. But now that it's working it's pretty great. You need to be sure of a few things before you buy this. First off, you'd better have at least 16volts of power going to your doorbell. Most newer homes have this but older homes may not. Second, your wifi had better work well OUTSIDE your house. I installed the RingPro with my front door open and it all worked fine. Then I finished the install, closed the door and it stopped working because the wifi signal was suddenly too weak. It took a while (and a lot of cursing) to figure out that the door was the problem. I ultimately had to intstall a wifi repeater in the foyer in order to successfully complete the install. Overall, I like the product and will likely buy another but I wish it hadn't been so difficult.<br><br>UPDATE: After 36 hours it went offline and required 3 attempts at reconnecting to WiFi before it came back online. Minus 2 stars. One more event like this and it goes back.

  After a little trouble getting it to work with my chime (totally my fault, but Ring support was really good in working with me to fix it), it's in and working great. We have the doorbell and two cameras. The only down-side is that I haven't figured out quite how to filter notifications and alerting vs recording yet. The particular use case is that I have motion zones set up for just my front yard (so that I don't get a notification every time someone drives by), but my neighbor had his truck rifled through and it'd be nice to see everything that happened that night.<br><br>The cloud storage costs are totally reasonable, the device was easy to install and just works.

  Great doorbell camera and video.  This is my second Ring Video Doorbell Pro. I purchased this one as a gift for a family member that fell in love with the one at my house. Installation was very easy and I like the fact there are multiple cover options that come with the doorbell. I defiantly feel the Ring Doorbell Pro is worth the initial purchase price, but don't agree with the monthly fee needed in order to record videos. I do personally pay the extra monthly fee, but would like to see an option to keep at least 2 or 3 videos without having a monthly subscription.  The live feed without subscription won't do you any good to watch someone stealing your packages and later have no evidence of the occurrence. I personally feel is just another way to continuously generate money off their loyal customers.<br><br> I do find the motion sensors lacking in catching motion at times.  If someone approaches my door quickly, I am lucky to get a recording of their back side walking away from my door.  I have also found when alerted by motion or actual ringing to the door. By the time the app opens up and I get a live feed on my phone the person has already left.  With software updates and equipment I'm sure this will only get better. Overall this to me is one of the best Video Doorbells around so far, but will have way my options if other manufactures can offer the same quality video and with better monthly fees if not free recordings..

I ended up returning it after much frustration and almost giving up on smart doorbells. On whim I bought this model and OMG what a difference. Installing the unit took about 10 minutes and the unit connected with our wifi seamlessly. After a total of 15 minutes, things were working 100%. Wish I bought this from the get go. My only complaint / suggestion - the drill bit they provided with the kit sucked.  Throw it out and use a real bit.

  We ordered the Ring Video Doorbell Pro on April 27, 2017 and had it professionally installed in early May. The main purpose for the Ring is to monitor who comes to knock (ring) on my elderly Mother's door. My sister and I both downloaded the Ring app and were able to monitor the activity at my Mom's door - sort of. The Ring is great when it works, but unfortunately, that's not often. It constantly disconnects from wi-fi even after installing a new wi-fi router nearby. We have an ARLO camera in the house that rarely ever disconnects. It's now mid-July and the newest problem is, the Ring has been on the blink, completely without power for over a week. I've hired an expensive electrician to come and ""fix"" the problem - twice. He claims it's an issue with the unit. I'm tired of this. I just want it to work consistently. It doesn't.

I've got a new-ish dual band Motorola router combo to which I have at least two dozen devices connected to and never had a problem. I spent over 4 hours trying to get this to work. I called the Ring Company help desk and spent nearly two hours on the phone with them.  The Ring would connect to the router and then would never pass the ""connectivity test"" no matter how many times i tried.  The company help desk told me to return the first unit...which I did. The second unit had the exact same problem...and also would never pass the ""connectivity test"" even after it found and connected to my wifi.  So i've given up.

To do this you have to remove the devices from the app, change the address and then set them back up.  I removed the device (Ring Pro and Chime) and changed my address.  The devices would not configure in the app.  I am very comfortable with technology, work in networking industry.  It just didnt work.  I called support spent 1.5 hrs doing all the things I had already tested, but I know support needs to do that.  After getting to level 2 escalation the answer was, ""Well it's been over a year so you are no longer in support you need to buy new equipment.  We will give you 35% off.""  I asked for a manager.  Was told I was going to get escalated and they would get back to me.  No response since.<br><br>UPDATE:  Move to (4 Stars from 1) After leaving my review, the Ring Team contacted me to discuss my frustration.

  I was initially really happy with this purchase. After I got past the installation annoyances and the fact that I felt like I got bait and switched with the cloud payments, it was working well. All of a sudden, my Ring Doorbell just shut off (no notification that it was disconnected from wifi of course). I didn't find out until my guests knocked on the door because my ring randomly turned off (which was super embarrassing).<br><br>I started digging around online and soon found out that there is a built-in battery within the ring doorbell. Batteries are obviously not forever, and when they go out, the unit is dead. I did see that you could replace the battery on your own, but looking at the steps, it is not an easy job and there is no direct replacement part you can order so you would have to custom fit a battery rated the same. I thought that this would be completely hard-wired so I had no idea that it had a limited shelf-life. If I knew this, I would never had purchased one. Of course, because I am past the 1 year warranty, I won't be getting a replacement anytime soon.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and look into other options. I can no longer give my stamp of approval on Ring products anymore.

  If you are planning to purchase a RING Pro before you do so I highly recommend check your doorbell transformer before you buy and consider upgrading it.  RING needs a 16 volt AC transformer that delivers ~30VA.  Initially the installation and setup of the RING PRO was pretty straightforward with good directions and the RING PRO ran for a few hours before quitting and it took a few days of trouble shooting to associate it with the transformer.  I ordered a new recommended transformer directly from RING.  I again attempted to set up the RING PRO however this time despite correct voltage I still received a low voltage warning on the APP and again the RING PRO quit after a few hours.  In further reading of the manual they indicate that you may have to bypass your mechanical chime completely so RING PRO has enough voltage and they give instructions to do that.  That seemed to fix the voltage issue however I was unable to reconnect to my router.  I spent quite a bit of time with tech support to discover there was something wrong with my RING PRO so the tech staff ordered a new one to be sent with a return envelope in 5 days.  Well 5 days later and no new RING PRO.  I emailed tech support again and apparently they never sent the replacement RING PRO!  They resubmitted the request, in the meantime my ""free"" 30 days subscription to the cloud has expired and I still do not have a working RING PRO.  At this time I cannot recommend this product but will update my experience when ""hopefully"" the new RING PRO arrives.

  I am a low voltage electrical contractor. So I know what I am doing and this is in my wheelhouse. But the first one I did for a customer I didn't know what to expect. Now that I have done 10 others I see what was wrong. Basically Ring sold me a defective one and it took 4 tech support people over 6 calls for about 5 hours to figure out it didn't work. I was able to give them very good feedback and tell them exactly what they needed to know to properly troubleshoot. But they were clueless. Then they did an RMA and shipped me a replacement. That took 8 days. To a customer, 8 days means you suck as a contractor. God forbid you get a defective one, you are probably better off throwing it out and buying a new one.

  It’s definitely a handy little device. I love that I can monitor my door through the RING phone app. Also through the app, it will give access to a forum for neighbors with the RING doorbell. Your neighbors within in a 5 mike radius can post what the doorbell records to the forum.  Usually it’s someone trying to sell something but sometimes it’s some drunk showing up to the wrong house at 2:00am in the morning. The view from this doorbell is crystal clear and it is also has a motion sensor that detects movement. I recommend turning that down or you’ll know every time the wind blows. You can also speak into your phone if someone is at the door, you can talk to people at your door from anywhere like at work or on vacation somewhere. It records up to a minute every time someone triggers the sensor so you can send that video to authorities if it’s something you think is sketchy. Would give it 10 stars if I could.  Great purchase!

  For something that is advertised as a quick installation this was anything but easy.  Now that it works I can say that it works fine and mostly meets expectations.  If it wasn't for the install issues I would have given it 4 stars.<br><br>Getting it to work was a 10 day event, replacing transformers, calls with Ring Support, and Amazon shipping out a new Ring doorbell pro.  My problem was despite having good voltage at the wires measured with a multi-meter the connected ring device it would not power up.  I read other reviews of people saying it could take up to 24 hours to power on the first time.  I waited 48 hours and nothing.  I replaced my transformer to a 24v 40VA unit and had the same issues.  After working with Ring support it was determined best course of action was my unit was DOA and return to Amazon and get a new one shipped out.  The other option was bypassing my mechanical doorbell with a cable they sent me.  The ""new"" ring pro shipped to me by Amazon had clearly been previously opened since all the seals were cut.  But nothing looked to be missing so I forged on wanting to get it working.<br><br>The 2nd unit behaved just like the first one and would not power on.  I finally decided to try to hook it up directly to the transformer using the fused cable Ring sent me in between.  Initially it did not power on but after about 20 minutes it lit up.  Then I took it outside and reinstalled.  Now it powers up fine.<br><br>I don't know what is going on.  The reports about it taking a long time to power on initially indicates that it has some sort of stored charge device in it.  Whether that is a battery or capacitor I don't know.  I know it has stored charge since when it's disconnected from power it continues to work for a short period of time.  This stored charge is probably to combat issues with a traditional mechanical door bells sucking to much current or breaking the circuit when the doorbell in rung.  It allows the ring to continue to have power, like a very small uninterruptible power supply.<br><br>I suspect my problem is a lack of sufficient current that is being delivered over the wires initially to trip the charging circuit to turn on.  Since the battery/capacitor does not charge it will not start up.  After getting it installed and added to the app it says I have very good voltage at 4307mV.<br><br>I think the bottom line is Ring (bought by Amazon today) needs to do some work on the internal design. Fix the initial power up issues, and something to better indicate what is happening.  Some simple LEDs on the back just to show status would be nice.  I suspect they get a ton of returns as a result of them not powering on.

  The button on this will get a vertical crack very shortly after the warranty expires. I posted on this problem (there was already a thread) on the Ring site maybe 6 months ago. I get notifications in my email up to 5 per week about others who have the same problem hoping to hear of a fix or that Ring will take responsibility for this issue. Some have mentioned that they have been offered a 40% discount to buy another but since they have not addressed the problem, why would anyone do so? I believe some mentioned that Ring support said the button should not be exposed to too much sunlight. So I guess this it the ideal doorbell for inside your house. Really though, if you need something that will last more than a year or two, look elsewhere. And definitely do not take my word for this, do yourself a favor and just google ""Ring Pro cracked button"" before plunking down your money on this terribly engineered product.<br>To be fair, before the button cracked, I loved this thing. It still works well but knowing what kind of support I have received I am still bitter.

  First unit was defective, as determined after 3 calls to tech support which were a polite bunch but I know more about troubleshooting this thing than they did. (""Can you shake the power adapter? If you hear something rattle it might have a blown fuse."")  After all those calls I came away with the impression that Ring Pro is a touchy thing, sensitive to voltage from the doorbell transformer. I hope its not going to be rendered inop or dead after every brownout.<br><br>Speaker isn't really loud enough for people at the front door to hear you on a windy day or with a truck driving by. And the time it takes from a doorbell press...to an alert on your phone...to unlocking your phone...to the video then buffering and showing up on your phone screen is very long. I could see some people leaving in that amount of time thinking I'm not home. Not good if you want to make sure you are around to sign for a package, inadvertently great if you just want solicitors to leave.<br><br>Its the best looking of the smart doorbells and the video quality is quite good. If you are going to mount it immediately alongside your door, prepare to install the optional Ring mounting adapter or a piece of bevel case moulding under it to angle the camera more toward where people will be standing directly in front of the door.

  Ha! I love how Ring insists that the installation is simple. My electrician/handyman said this is one of the worst products he has ever had to deal with. So glad I called him instead of some random install person. No way they could have wired this to my existing bell properly. I tried the regular Ring Doorbell first, but sent it back. it only worked when charging with a cable connected to my computer! The Ring customer service is a joke. Completely untrained to handle any tech issues. Not sure they can read honestly. Seriously, if you want a camera and viewing abilities of your home with your phone, there are better options. Ring is a waste. Update, Ring read this review and contacted me. They sent another doorbell. Same issues. Then a third. Just stopped working one day, and was never revived. Now, I can't return via Amazon, and I have a sad clump of hardware in a drawer. I've gone back to old school for now, but have purchased another brand. If I could give a negative 3 stars, I would.

  If you already have a powered doorbell (lights up with chime), then I would recommend the Ring Pro.  The installation instructions are very easy to follow, but be warned:  16-24 V transformer is required, with 20 VA recommended.  I know this very well because our new construction house doorbell is probably only a 12 V and we have had minor issues.  The Ring Pro still works, but if you overuse it, it may power down and give an error code until the power is back in spec.<br><br>Overall, we've been using our Ring Pro for about a week and I have to say that it works as promised - even with the transformer issue (which really only affected us the first night).  The camera quality is great.  It provides great video in all levels of light:  daylight, direct sun, evening/twilight, night mode, and night mode with street lights - we can see our porch and even the street very clearly.<br><br>It offers excellent field of view, great resolution and very easy interface to set up your Ring to do exactly what you want.  You want a security camera?  Set the motion setting to sensitive and set the polygon capture area to include everything.  Be warned - you'll get hundreds of warnings and video clips to review if you do this, as every little thing will set it off (cars, shadows, insects, etc).<br><br>You only want the Ring to alert you whenever a person walks up our just to guard your walk way?  Change the settings and scan area simply by using your phone or tablet.  Or turn the motion and scan area off and it'll literally be a fancy doorbell with phone/video interface.<br><br>Night mode works great and we have found no video quality issues whether we view our Ring remotely via 3G/4G or via WiFi.  The sound quality isn't great, but like another reviewer stated, if you view the Ring Pro as an awesome camera that offers sound instead of a fully functional video camera, then you won't be disappointed!<br><br>Cons:  there aren't many.  The app interface sometimes won't load the video from my notifications (I'm using Samsung on Android, so I don't know if that matters since my wife's iPhone doesn't have this issue) and one time our chime didn't go off, but the phone notifications did alert us and we still answered the door.  Does this really matter?  Not to us, but I want to give you the honest feedback.  Btw, this is the only reason why I give it a 9/10 instead of a 10.<br><br>I installed this in about 30 minutes.  It only took so long because I couldn't find the correct breaker to isolate the doorbell transformer!  Just follow the guide and watch the video clips.  Finally, be patient and give your Ring an overnight to remain at power before you play with it.  I would have sworn that our Ring was a brick that needed to be returned, but the Ring tech support was very good at explaining the power situation and how to fix it if it continued to be an issue (again, since the first night, this hasn't been an issue).<br><br>All in all, this is a good product that seems to work as promised!

  The Ring Doorbell Pro is a wonderful device, works as advertised.  It was easy to install and we enjoy the fact that we can see, and speak to, whoever is at our door.  The motion sensor is very sensitive, which you can control.  We like that we can set sensor zones and have it ignore other zones since there's a lot of cats in our neighborhood.  Because of that we set the zones up off the ground and we have few false motion alerts.  Being able to join the neighborhood program has been good also, neighbors post video of packages being stolen, some right out of the back yard where the courier left them in hopes they wouldn't be stolen. Many are putting the cameras around their homes to pick up activity at several points.<br>All in all this device works as advertised and we find it reliable.  If you're not in WiFi range with the mobile device you use the app on there is going to be a delay, depending on how strong the cell service is at your location.  That can be worked around though. We liked it so much we purchased one for our nephew and his familly.

  Installation takes a lot longer than the original ring since you not only have to set up the camera outside but you also need to hook up the doorbell box. Just a warning for people with an older transformer in their house to check the voltage. My transformer was only 10 volts which was underpowered. You need at least 16 volts so I had to change out our transformer for the ring pro to work properly. Also I had an electrical doorbell and it won’t stop ringing once I connected the power pro kit. I had to buy a mechanical doorbell to swap it out. I had a lot of issues with the installation process. But once I got it up and running then it works fine. The video quality is better than the original ring by far. The sensitivity is better as well and it doesn’t get set off by cars driving by like my original ring. You can actually physically set up your motion sensor area on the grid so it does not get set off improperly. I added pictures of how you can adjust your motion sensor region option. I think if installation was easier than I would have given it 5 stars.

  I was really excited to get my Ring Video Pro.  I'm a tech/gadget guy and am good with electrical wiring, so I was confident this would be a good purchase.  Unfortunately the device didn't work at first -- apparently my doorbell transformer doesn't have enough power for both the doorbell chime and the Ring doorbell camera.  My doorbell was making a buzzing sound and nothing worked.  This was surprising since my house is less than 10 years old.  I contacted Ring support (which was great) and they sent me a ""Pro Power Cable"" which bypasses by doorbell chime so all the power goes to the camera.  This work but I no longer can use my old doorbell.  Ring also sent me an electronic doorbell that plugs into an outlook, and that works fine.  I've had the product working for a week and so far, so good.  The video and audio quality is good and I've adjusted the motion window so I don't get false alerts.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase.  The great tech support is what has made me a happy customer.

  The Ring Pro has been a great investment for our home. As a stay at home mom in a new neighborhood  (new city and state to boot) this has given me peace of mind in answering the door, as well as monitoring what happens in my front yard. I love it so much that I purchased 2 Ring Stick Up cameras. Now I feel comfortable going camping for the weekend knowing that if anything goes on at my home, Ring will let me know. I am still toying with the motion settings, but I'm getting closer to having it set perfectly.<br><br>Update: once we repositioned our wireless router, we kept losing signal to the Ring Pro doorbell. Understandably so, as our router is in the basement- the furthest point from the doorbell. I purchased a wifi extender for $30 and linked it up with our wifi. It is plugged in in our kitchen and gives the doorbell great signal. Easy fix.<br><br>Update at 2 year mark: The doorbell still works great and has been a really good investment. I did run into an issue recently where the doorbell seemed to be dead. It is hooked into the electric in my home, so I wasn’t sure why it wasn’t working. I called Ring and turns out a power surge kicked it offline and the built in battery died. A quick flip of the breaker and the doorbell came right back on!

The only thing is that we could not get the mechanical doorbell to work, although the dog barks like crazy with the regular doorbell and does not with the ring chime, which is a lot more peaceful than before.  So we have not tried to re-wire it and I have it turned off in my settings.  I also have had no luck changing the chime yet.  I keep getting an error, but not a big deal.

But so far, because the resolution of the camera is so clear, we have had no problems seeing who is actually at the door.  I figure if we talk to the person at the door they will look at the doorbell/camera and can be identified that way.  I still haven't decided if we are going to subscribe to a cloud service, I don't want to pay for it, but I haven't looked into alternatives yet.  I still have a week or so to decide.

  The video quality of the Ring Doorbell Pro is excellent.  Setup was straightforward, but you may have to drill and place molly's in the wall stucco if your existing doorbell is not the exact same foot print.  Not a big deal though. The entire installation took less than 30 minutes and that includes adding the power pack to the existing chime.  Ring included a concrete bit and all the necessary pieces to complete the installation. The mobile interface is slick and allows for live viewing without being activated by the doorbell.  My wife and kids have the app on their mobile devices so everyone can see when someone approaches the entryway.  Night vision is good.  I have my Ring setup with SmartThings so whenever someone presses the Ring Door Bell or it detects motion, my front porch light turns on (Sunset - Sunrise).  This really isn't necessary but it does provide a bit more light at night.<br><br>The deciding factor of purchasing Ring vs a competitor's product  was the ease of integration with SmartThings.  That was a must for me as my home is now fairly automated.  I'm highly pleased with the unit so far (4 weeks in) and will be adding additional Ring products in the future.

The most important thing for me was the size of it.  It was only slightly larger than the normal door bell button.  My old door bell was mounted on the door frame so there was only a small space for me to mount it.  The mounting was super easy.  I unscrewed and removed the old door bell button and connected the wiring, mounted and screwed the Ring Pro door bell back on the door frame and that was it.  The door bell has been working flawlessly for the last month.  I love getting notifications while I'm away from the house.

  It’s pretty useless. Everything is hooked up right and my live view will pop right up. But anytime I answer a ring or motion, the video won’t load.

I’ve run diagnostics and it says it’s signal strength and Wi-Fi download speed is good.  Another negative is that it doesn’t work with my doorbell chime, so I would have to pay for an actual “ring chime” . The video quality is good for day and night and gives a wide view.

  The doorbell is an amazing piece of work. The design, the concept are all great. However, in order to get the most out of it, you must use the app, and frankly it needs a lot of work. When not on local wifi, it's slow to respond with choppy video (and I have a very high signal at the bell, so it's not that). There are few ways to control the app; the notification sound cannot be changed, and it's not very loud at all. The badge app doesn't work. On the computer app, the window automatically opens to show the door; the phone app needs to do the same. With a really fine app, this would be an out-of-the-park home run. It's still worth the price (even though I lost a lot of money by not waiting a week and getting it during Prime Days), but it could be so much better.

  I've owned the Ring Pro for a little more than a year and decided to write a review because of the great customer service I received from the Ring team after having a problem. Like others (some of whom have left negative reviews here) I experienced a sudden drop in audio quality followed by complete device failure. I went through all the troubleshooting steps suggested by the Ring support agent and nothing worked. I was concerned that they were going to tell me ""too bad"" because I was just outside of the one-year warranty period but, to my surprise, they offered to replace the unit at no charge. I spoke to two different support agents on two different occasions and both of them were friendly and helpful from the start. They seem to have a very sincere interest in helping me fix the problem and getting me back to having a fully functioning doorbell cam. They were also very open to feedback about their services and support process. I won't go into detail here, but suffice to say they listened to my suggestions and I truly believe that they will be passed on to supervisors that can act on them. I went from being an unhappy customer who was considering a competitor's product to being a huge Ring fan instantly because of the customer service I received. All I can say to Ring is ""Please keep it up"", and I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a doorbell cam. There is a new version out (v3) and it appears that they have resolved many of the issues with the previous Pro models. Thanks RIng!

  I have spent a month working with Ring technicians trying to get clear images from the videos recorded by my Ring Doorbell Pro.<br><br>The problem can be seen by comparing the two attached images captured from Ring Pro video.  The first is a FedEx delivery at dusk with artificial lighting (from two sixty-watt bulbs).  The face of this FedEx driver is so blurry there is no way to identify him.  That’s the problem.  The second image, from the same doorbell on the next day, shows a UPS delivery at noon which is perfectly clear.  Why is the FedEx image so blurry?<br><br>Ring support has had me running around with changing the wireless network (from 2.4G to 5G, back to 2.4G), updating firmware, measuring upload and download speeds at numerous locations inside and outside the house.  Throughout all this, the measured upload speed was never below 17 Mbps (on the 2.4G network) and 23 Mbps (on the 5G network).  Everything on the doorbell also checked out. Nevertheless, the problem persists.<br><br>Today, a Ring technician confirmed there is nothing wrong with my connection or my Ring Pro doorbell.  The problem is that 1500 lumens of light is insufficient for the Ring Pro to record a clear image of a body in motion.<br><br>I conclude that the Ring cameras have inherently poor light sensitivity.  Under low light conditions, the camera has to reduce shutter speed to get the right exposure.  And with the inherently poor light sensitivity of the Ring camera, the shutter is open so long that objects in motion unavoidably become blurred.<br><br>And it doesn’t take much motion to mess things up.  Turn your head from left to right or simply walk toward the doorbell, that is enough motion to blur a face beyond recognition.  The light sensitivity of all Ring models are allegedly all the same, the only difference is resolution.  A higher resolution model will NOT overcome this low light blurring problem.<br><br>An objective comparison of the attached sample images proves the point.<br><br>To be fair, daytime images from the Ring Pro are good, and problem described here only manifests itself in low light conditions recording bodies in motion. Unfortunately, porch pirates and other miscreants tend to move quickly and under cover of darkness, the very same two conditions where Ring doorbells fail.<br><br>Those looking for clear security images under lower light conditions should avoid Ring doorbells.

I would happily hook it up to record on my NVR, but Ring does not let you do this.  Another option would be to provide the service for Amazon prime members, which I have been for many years.<br><br>2)  The external ring tone cannot be changed.  They do allow you to turn the volume to zero, but it cannot play any other tune when someone rings your doorbell.<br><br>Otherwise I am quite happy with the product, but the real value from a home security standpoint goes away unless you are willing to pay a subscription fee.

  I was very disappointed in this product. For the commercials, you expect flawless and easy operation, but in reality, it doesn't work that way. This product failed to sound my already installed doorbell. After hours of troubleshooting on multiple days. The company is sending me a new unit. The technical support team is friendly and competent, but I should have to do all of that troubleshooting in the first place.  It worked as a camera with motion alerts, but if my phone wasn't near me, I was in the dark about someone being at the door. I missed a pizza delivery because of the operation of this item. Additionally, I was never able to talk to people at the door like in the commercials, only look at them and record.<br><br>Update 9/13 Ring customer care was awesome sending me a new unit that works. They truly care about the customer which is why I am updating this review.

  I liked that most everything you need to do the install is included. The tool they provide has a Phillip’s end and a Star end. My old doorbell had slotted heads. Swiss Army Knife worked fine to remove it. All of the pictures and videos that I saw demonstrated the doorbell being installed on a flat surface. The facing around my door is fluted. The old much more narrow doorbell had putty sealing the top and bottom. The Ring is much taller and wider than the old bell. Went to the hardware store and got a tube of caulking. This appears to have sealed the back to the elements. We connected the doorbell to our Echo Spot. Now when the bell is rung we can see who it is from our kitchen. My wife didn’t care for the color of any of the covers. Just went with the silver one. It wasn’t a deal breaker. No more answering the door to be confronted by a salesmen! So far we are satisfied.

  Before I start I would like to say, that I have some IT background and experience with NEST and Netgear wifi cameras. I really want to like this product. When it works it's really nice. However it's not ready for the market, there is no quality control, no development to address known issues and now it lacks customer support.  I own the ring bell for 6 months and this is my second unit. The quality is very inconsistent. At the location of the door bell I have 200 Mb download and 50 Mb upload. The self diagnostic mode doesn't detect any issues and I still have issues with streaming video and playback. The picture is very choppy and freeze up a lot. The only possible explanation would be poor wifi signal, however I tried multiple wifi settings and as I mentioned my speeds at the location are an overkill for this camera is suppose to do.  Now I started having issues with the infrared being stuck, so my daytime picture is black/white. Tried the hard reset few time but the issue always comes back. The customer support team, when they used to pick the phone blamed it on my wifi network. Now they  don't pick up the phone and if you place yourself in call back line they never call you back. It feels like they are going out of business or something. I bought the ring cameras, but I am planning to return them back and switch to a completely different system. Hopefully things will improve over time. I wish them luck!

  The doorbell works very well. The audio quality of the person at the door can be a little distorted, but that’s probably because people think they have to stand directly over it and yell into it. If they stand back from it and speak normally, the audio is OK. It does take some trial and error to set the sensitivity level and the motion detection range. If you don’t set it correctly, you’ll pick up cars on the street and people walking their dogs. Also, you will need a good WiFi signal. If the WiFi on your porch is weak, you will need to plug in a WiFi extender near the door. (This is true for all Ring products.)<br><br>ONE BIG ADVISORY!!! A small special tipped screwdriver comes with the doorbell for installation. DO NOT LOSE IT OR THROW IT OUT! If you ever have to do a reset on the doorbell, you will need the screwdriver to remove the cover to get to the reset button.

  The Ring doorbell pro looks good and is a great idea but the quality of the product is underwhelming to say the least.  With-in a year the plastic doorbell button fails. It cracks due to use and I assume heat from the sun. I live in Northern California and my door faces West.  I reached out to the manufacture and the help desk is pleasant but spare parts are not sold. They simply direct me to purchase a new unit. I would hate to have to buy a new unit every 12-15 months.  Clearly the Ring team needs to better test the environmental impact on their products and improve the durability.  There is ever increasing compaction out there now.

  Update:<br>Since we were able to find a Ring that worked correctly, I have been very happy with the Ring Pro.  The customer service is superb.  I love the concept of the Ring doorbell and the new Ring Pro works fine but is still a tiny bit contrary with black screen once in a blue moon, not so much as before but just on occasion.  Sometimes when someone rings the bell the video and audio is choppy and hard to understand but most of the time it is awesome.<br>Old Review:<br>I wanted so much to like this product (I just had to have one) but I just can't get past the constant failures. I admit I have only had 2 weeks but since it was installed it has had to be soft reset every day or at least every other day and hard-reset 3 times. It goes offline constantly or gets stuck in night mode.  It is very finicky.  Apparently it is not compatible with my door chime, so ok, I can deal with that (it has a fairydust chime on phone app) but the constant resets are a real pain.  Customer service asks the same questions and direct you to run the same tests over and over. I just don't have that much free time to play with it everyday especially when it keeps acting up daily. The units ""Device Health"" says all is good to very good (voltage, signal etc) until out of the blue its offline again or stuck in night mode.  ""Try the chime extender"" they say.  At list price $250.00, I did get $75.00 off but even at that price why would I want to keep putting more money into an already overpriced doorbell.  There is no guarantee that would work either. Until I bought this product, I used the free Alfred app on my old smart phone.  I just set up in the window by the door.  Little cheesy looking but it was dependable.

  I heard good things about this product. I installed it, it worked fine but then went dead in 30 min. Turns out you need a 16 to 24 volt transformer in your indoor doorbell/ chime. This is NOT called out on the box/ specs and shouldn't be expected! Most houses have 10-16v, spent 3 calls and several hours with their customer service. They suggested opening my wall and changing the transformer! Ring wouldn't do anything. Thank goodness for Amazon customer service! They supported their customer and allowed a return!

  Pretty easy to install (wiring to our original doorbell), however the first instruction said to push an orange button on the back of the unit...and there was none! Annoying. Tried to call Ring, and was told they would do an automatic callback, but they never called back. We ignored the whole button pushing thing and proceeded with install (turns out there is now a black button on the side of the unit). It works great.<br>The range is good and and it is easy to set the sensitivity or turn off the motion detector alerts (as we did when we were getting our gutters replaced). The pictures are clear.<br>One problem we've had is that when we answer the door and talk to people via our smartphone, the person at the door has had trouble hearing/understanding us. I don't know if there is a way to turn up or adjust the volume? I plan to call, but have been too busy. We really want it to be clear, so that even if we aren't home, whoever is at the door will think we are (deterrent).<br>Second issue is that when motion is detected and I click on to see the live view/video, it's always after the fact. I have to wait until the video is saved/downloaded, then go back and view it. Usually that's only a couple of minutes, and then the motion detected will show up (ie neighbor leaving, leaves blowing, someone walking by).<br>We are still fine tuning and getting used to it, but so far Ring is quite promising and adds extra peace of mind to our home security.

  It has really good quality picture during day.  Night vision is decent quality.  If it becomes necessary to reset the doorbell to get it to connect to wi-fi, it is a pain for me because the reset button is on the side that is right next to the brick, therefore, I have to take the door bell off to get to the reset button, definitely a pain.  However, so far I’ve only had to actually remove it once and I’ve had it about 2 months.  Resetting my router worked the second time it lost connectivity.  The down side is that it cost $3 a month minimum if you want to record motion.  I would not buy again because of the $3 a month charge.  Arlo cloud storage is FREE!

  So far I've had my Ring doorbell pro for about 2 weeks. I love the idea of a doorbell security camera. The only negatives I have found is that there is sometimes a lag between when the motion alert is sent to when someone is actually at the door. Your transformer has to be the recommended power rating, or your doorbell will not have enough power to power the Ring and your original chime. I opted for the Ring range extender and paired with my Alexa Dot that was included with my purchase, I can hear the doorbell ring at the other end of the house now. I wish the angle wedges were included in the purchase price.

Tested and they confirmed I wired it correctly.  Called customer service 2nd time (they were nice enough) to learn it is probably part of a defective batch where the battery (called capacitor) was completely drained.  They are sending me a new one in couple days.  Couple things to be aware of:  1) make sure the transformer on your doorbell is at least 16V, better to be 24V.  If not you will need to replace it.  2) If it does not power up in the first hour of ""charging"", don't fool with it and demand a replacement.  If you google ""Pro power up problems"" you will see tons of articles and videos on this problem.  I am really disappointed that I have to wait a week and cross my fingers the 2nd unit will actually work.  Very disappointed in product.  Customer service was OK.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Install Video Doorbell Pro on 4-8 tone chime,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019","<span>
  The end result is exceptional. The validity on ""15-minute install"", 6 full struggling hours over 3 days, does not even begin to express the level of frustration...<br>- For years I had a single doorbell system at the front door. Two wires from a 16V 10Amp transformer in the attic and two wires from doorbell bi kitchen in middle of house going to the button at the front door which was also illuminated.  The great differentiator was that the bell itself was a fancy triple echo chamber brass unit producing a mechanical (powered magnet coils) beautiful old world charm sound, like a London cathedral calling Mass.  Beautiful up to the point when I tried to wire the new Ring Pro.  Tried every wiring diagram from Ring site choices and internet videos and nothing worked. Not only did it not work, but I burnt 2 different 16 volt transformers and in one attempt got a 9 volt battery boiling - a very cool but frightening effect.<br>- So I am documenting the end result (very satisfactory) here:<br>The bell chrome system does not have 2 dumb terminals (Transformer and Front). Does not even have Transformer and Front, Back, whatever! It has 3 Transformer terminals and 3 other door button ones (one of which is Front).  It also has two 9V battery connectors as ""alternate wiring choice B"".  For 10 years the wiring was Choice A, where Transformer terminals 2 and 3 went to the transformer, one button wire went to the door, and the second back to terminal 3.<br>Turns out the chimes with their long echo chambers (like a church organ but longest is 12 inches) require direct power from the transformer.  The ""B"" wiring choice, powers the chimes from two 9V batteries, while the door button light and ring button are from the transformer.<br><br>To summarize:<br>- Only choice ""B"" wiring will work, but nothing like it is documented anywhere<br>- You absolutely need a 16V 30Amp transformer instead of the crappy 5-10Apm cheap garbage most contractors install to ensure Ring is happy. I read countless 1 and 2 star ratings from people that don't get this. If you spend two hundred bucks for a smart video doorbell, please spend the 20 for a capable transformer. Once I did that, video became flawless and so did wireless connectivity (against an otherwise excellent home WiFi setup).<br>- Choice B requires 2 x 9V batteries on this chime (other even fancier chimes have a choice of a separate transformer and two power wires from that just permanently powering the chime coils). Get that part powered first after disconnecting all other wires from the chime.<br>- Then, follow Ring power cell instructions religiously. In my case, one leg goes on Terminal 1 (the only transformer power terminal in chime's wiring B scheme (instead of two transformer wires on terminals 2 and 3 without Ring)<br>- Then, the second leg of the Ring power cell goes where they tell you, on the terminal marked Front<br>- Now, in this B schema wiring, take one of the transformer wires and attach also to Terminal 1<br>- Now, connect the second transformer wire to one of the two wires going to the Ring (door button) and secure<br>- Take the remaining wire coming back from the Ring (door button) and add it to the Front terminal where the ssecond Ring power cell wire is.<br>Done. Leave a little time for everything to power up and if you got it right, the Ring doorbell is ready to setup and lit up, the chime is not ringing or making any bell coil arming sounds, and the two 9V batteries are cold to the touch (no transformer power feeding back into them erroneously).<br>Took me hours of testing and research for what otherwise seems simple, but it was not yet documented.<br>Enjoy. I love the end result and Ring performs great, so I went for the yearly subscription with no further reservation.<br>I cannot speak yet to how well that works or any lag between motion detection and recording (as some report) but I will revisit after a couple of months of use.<br>Time to catch that Sunday newspaper thief!

After purchasing the Ring Video Door Bell Pro, the Wired Spot Light Cam and a Chime Pro I would have to say they work really well. After installing the spot light cam and door bell pro they were very easy to link with the Ring app. I purchased the chime pro as my WiFi router is on one end of my home. Chime pro works well also. I gave the cams a week or so and ended up purchasing 3 Stick Up Cams (plug-ins) and a Spot Light Cam Mount (wired).  You can link all devices and control each from the app. The cams can be moved around the house until you find the perfect spot.<br>I would recommend using a Chime Pro if you live in a brick home and install outside cams that may not get a very good WiFi signal.(placement of chime pro is key)<br>I have 6 cams and only linked Chime Pro to the 3 outside cams.

  I have two of the original doorbelks and they have been great. The ring pro doorbell has been a serious headache. It first required resetting the wifi password to a password without characters such as !, #, or &amp;. It seem like a minor problem, but one device with a preference for weak passwords required resetting 25 other devices to the new password. It just became more problematic from there. It keep going offline every few days,which required a hard reset every time (removing the cover and holding the side button for several second). In looking at potential troubleshooting a weak/old 16v transformer was the main suspect. I ran to the hardware store and a employee who had similar problems with the ring pro (not a good sign) convinced me to disconnect the mechanical door chime and purchase ring chime. He reasoning was it draws too much power and causes the doorbell to lose power. I was doubtful, but hopeful it would solve the problem. It worked for 24 hours and went offline again. I returned and purchased a 24v transformer as per the manufacturer troubleshooting guides. This worked for a few days and offline again. The last step was calling ring and they sent me a pro power wire to connect it directly to the transformer. That worked for a few days and went offline again. Thankfully Amazon excepted the return after 30 days. Thanks Amazon!

No video available yet as now I have to quickly gram my phone, enter finger print, open the Ring App, and open live view. If the person is still there, I can talk and listen to them by enabling voice and speaker. The commercials make it appear the app opens instantly where you can see and talk to people.

  I liked the Idea of a security camera that I wouldn't have to run wiring to so I paid the extra money for what I think is a kinda pricey wifi camera. It was easy enough to install, there were no surprises and I'm glad I ordered the movable base to get a better view. The picture quality is OK not great and the sound quality is really poor. The app was fairly simple to figure out and the 3 dollars a month for the cloud service seemed reasonable enough however more often than not the cloud service isn't available when I get an alert for motion, I get a connection error saying it couldn't load my locations. This is frustrating and its not because of my wifi or internet connection which is fiber optic right to the house with AT&amp;T's best plan. Whats the point of getting an alert if I can't answer the doorbell or see who's there? I would gladly give five stars if the service was better but most of the time it doesn't work.

When it came time for it to broadcast its temporary wifi signal, it would not show up on my network. Went to search troubleshooting - so I tried resetting it, resetting my router, and eventually logging in to my router (netgear) settings to make sure it was set up correctly and to try different channels (as suggested online and on Ring's website - although since I'm in US it wasn't broadcasting on a channel that was unusable to Ring). After trying several times, called Ring support line - and the customer service rep instantly told me there was a known issue with the Pro model and some software glitch they were working on that causes this exact wifi problem. His suggestion was to unhook the thing physically, wait 2-3 minutes, rewire it and wait another 10 minutes and try setup again. If that did not work, they could sent a replacement. So I did this, and no change, does not work. Therefore sending back to Amazon for refund.  Why if there is a known issue would Ring sell the thing in the first place!!!

  Great concept, we had the Ring installed professionally and it overheated and became very warm to the touch. That shouldn’t be. We called customer service several times with emails and they kept having us trouble shoot and nothing worked. After 4 phone calls and several hours on the phone they finally decided to replace it after my husband explained the same things over and over with no results. It very frustrating when everything is hooked up correctly and you get the run around. Anyway it was taken care of and were waiting on our new Ring. Hopefully its not a refurbished unit. I’ll update this once I know its working out or not.

  I bought this for peace of mind since I am often times away from my house . The ability to check in to see the front porch and keep an eye on packages left at the front door is great! Also you can set the motion to however sensitive you want.<br><br>Install was easy....at first....One day, the Ring Pro stopped working and there was no longer any power to it. I used the ring power pack that was supplied to install it... After calling ring customer service, they were unable to fix the power issue. I checked the voltage for the transformer and it showed 16 volts which is what the Ring Pro needs to operate... After checking wires, taking the power pack out and replacing it with the ""power cable wire"" ring provided, it still didn't work...<br><br>I finally went to Lowes and bought a new transformer that is rated for 16-24 volts. I replaced the transformer and set it for 24 volts. And to my surprise the doorbell started working again.<br><br>It's a great product but BUYERS BEWARE, the supplied ""power pack kit"" does not provide the maximum amount of volts(24) needed to operate the ring. Check your transformer to see what the rated voltage is before purchasing.

4.0 out of 5 stars,A fabulous system...but it will likely take a dedicated access point to get the performance,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2017","<span>
  I felt compelled to help buyers on this one since the reviews are all over the board. The Ring Doorbell Pro is a great device...with some caveats. After playing with it for a week, I've determined the following:<br><br>1) It requires a strong 5G connection to get the best performance. I see a number of reviews stating out of sync audio, skips, stops, etc. I too saw varied performance when trying to run 2.4G wireless. And...my wifi router was in the basement and not near the front door. The problem with 5G in this use case is that it doesn't penetrate thick walls. This is great to keep from getting 5G wifi conflicts with your neighbor but all of us have doorbells on an outer wall to the house. In that case, 5G was dying out from multiple points. 2.4G penetrates walls but I wasn't getting a strong enough signal and there was enough wifi conflict where I wasn't getting a good enough connection for top performance. So what did I do? I picked up a Netgear PLW1000 which runs as a wifi access point over electrical wire and put that thing right on the outlet on the other side of the wall from the doorbell. Not only did I get a strong 2.4G signal to it...but I got a ""green"" 5G signal to it because it was so close and was able to penetrate enough to use. The problem with all of this is it cost me $120! I decided to bite the bullet though because when performance is on, it's a good system. Note that running multiple wireless access points requires some networking knowledge. I've turned of the 2.4G radios on the other two I use to keep to just what I need. Wish I could be done with 2.4G altogether!<br><br>2) I see a lot of issues with false motions. I'm not sure how many are getting this from drawing the zones wrong. Just remember, look at the live view as a painting. Anything that will cross through the zone you drew on the painting can set off a motion. My motion zones are very small. I don't care who is walking on the sidewalk or what car is driving in the street. My zones start from just inside the sidewalk and cover only the places the picture would change that are actually on my property. Right now I've got the sensitivity in the middle. So far I have strong motion detection performance.<br><br>One thing to be aware of is that while the Ring system supports iOS, Android, and Windows 10, each app has a different flavor...and...the motion zones don't carry over properly. I drew mine in iOS but they don't show the same in the other apps.<br><br>If you can get the performance on the system, it's solid. Having to buy another access point at $120 though basically makes this a fairly expensive HW solution. I'd imagine you can try a dual band repeater in the same way but just keep in mind repeaters pretty much halve the performance through them on the bands you're repeating. I don't know if that will matter or not. You can get a 2.4G repeater for $40-50. Dual bands are more like $60-80.

  Initially, I liked the Ring based on personal reviews from friends who have multiple Ring products at their homes. However, I never asked anyone if they experienced some delay with their product. By the time mine notifies me a person has either walked past or I can get to my door faster than it’ll open within the app (depending on if I’m near my doors). Also, I purchased the Echo Show 5 (small I know) but for some reason, the Ring is way slower/delayed on that than it is my iPhone or iPad. This is weird because if I’m not mistaken Ring was bought or in partnership with Amazon - so I was expected them to pair much better. The delay is my major issue but when I’m not home, it seems to be okay because I can’t really tell the difference of the delay (but I already know that it’s there).

  The doorbell fails more than it works, no video or just fails to connect.  Customer service said the Spectrum Time Warner ISP upload speed of 4 is inadequate for their product, since the doorbell is small and not very powerful.  They said the unit transmits data like a cell phone, despite hard wiring for power, and I should have measured our upload speed on my cell phone before installing the product.  This procedure is not mentioned anywhere on the Ring.com website, nor in Amazon's description. The only mention of the requirement of upload speed is in the help troubleshooting section of the Ring web site for the Ring Pro, but not a word about measuring the upload speed only on a cell phone. For reference, this is a new house construction with a Netgear Nighthawk wireless router located 18 feet from the fiberglass front door and no metal walls between them.  (Customer service told me doors can be a problem blocking transmission of the Ring Pro doorbell signal.  Of course the fiberglass door has nothing to do with the problem.  Ring Pro doesn't connect with the front door open either.) Our speed tests on the laptop computer meet Spectrum Time Warner's specifications, so they have no inclination to look for a problem they do not believe exists.<br>When the RingPro application fails to connect, the doorbell is useless.  There is no chime and the only way to know someone is at your door is when you hear them knock.  The customer service rep said he would be happy to send me another Ring Pro but they all would act the same with the upload speed provided by Spectrum/Time Warner ISP.<br>If you are one of the over 20 million people who use Spectrum/Time Warner for ISP,  make sure you test your upload speed on your cellphone standing outside of your closed front door before making this purchase.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good coverage, good product",,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2019","<span>
  I am happy with this product and caught a decent sale that came with the echo show included. The doorbell gets pretty good coverage of my front yard without getting too much of my neighbors' yards. I think the two way talk on the visitor side could be a bit louder. Since my yard is small, the doorbell does capture motion each time a car goes up &amp; down the street so I had to modify my motion alert settings but I am happy that it captures that footage for whenever we park a car on the side of the street just in case of a hit and run. The picture seems pretty clear and gets pretty good vision at night too. The setup is pretty easy if you watch the videos; however, it can get tricky in the event that you need to replace your transformer. In that case, if you are unable to replace the transformer on your own, it could easily cost you more than the doorbell to hire an electrician. Luckily, we knew a qualified person who could do that especially because the placement of my transformer required cutting into the basement wall a bit to access it. Also, the fact that one of my doorbell wires was short made it difficult to add the wire extender, but should not be too much of an issue for someone who knows what they are doing. If it weren't for me needing a new transformer and having 1 short doorbell wire, the install would have been something I could have done on my own. I had no issues installing the power kit. Although the transformer part is only $20, plan to put away extra money to hire a professional if your transformer does not have the required voltage and if you are unsure if you can replace that yourself. I think that the plans that Ring offers to save your recordings are of reasonable price. $30 per year for one device is a good deal compared to the cost of some other options such as Vivint which requires you to commit to a lengthy and expensive contract. I have not signed up for the plan yet because I am still on my 30 day trial, but I plan to sign up once my trial is over. The live view can occasionally take some time to load and you should make sure that you a have a reliable internet connection if you plan to purchase this product. I have only had the doorbell up for 3 days but so far I have not had any wifi issues or incidents with the doorbell going offline. The doorbell does accurately alert me of a visitor each time someone walks into my property toward the door. I will likely purchase some other Ring products in the future. The packaging comes with a good amount of tools and was nice that it came with wire extenders. The app is also nice because it allows you to see footage of other nearby residents that have the ring product &amp; post footage to warn others of possible trouble.

  Overall the Ring doorbell lives up to the hype but could stand to be improved.  The doorbell itself works well and was extremely easy to install.  The instructions were very clear and the hardest thing was trying to synch the doorbell up with my wifi, which is only a few feet away but after restarting the process, it worked fine.  The video is very clear and the ability to set up highly customized movement zones works well.  We had deliveries and repairmen coming to the house all day and the detection worked well.  However the claim of an ""infrared"" capability is simply not true (that I could tell).<br><br>The app is not so great.  I use an iPhone and the app needs a complete redo in several areas but I realize that's a matter of personal choice.  The BIGGEST ISSUE I have with Ring is how to get the video on my phone.  Pre-purchase, on the Amazon product description it was not mentioned that a subscription service is required to get video, although I did see this requirement on a review website, so this wasn't a surprise.  The same site mentioned a free 30-day service but when I tried to get access to the video, the app said my service had expired (less than 3 days after I received the product).  Every option I tried to get an account via my iPhone failed; some with bad links.  I tried to access the website on a computer and the login I used on my Ring doesn't work, so I'll be spending some time with tech support.  It shouldn't be this hard to spend my money on a subscription!  Good thing I saved the very nice box because it's about one step from being returned.

  This was relatively easy to install on my own. Easy to wire and mount onto my door frame. Setup was quick and easy. But it did not operate well at all once installed. The doorbell was constantly going offline and having to be reset. Real pain having to pull the faceplate off and reset the thing once a week. When it was online, it would just buffer constantly after the app alerted me to motion/people. Basically useless as a smart doorbell when I can't ever pull up the camera and have to constantly reset it. I ended up returning as this was too frustrating to deal with and replacing with a Nest doorbell which has worked without issue.

  After using the Ring Pro for about seven months now, I couldn't be more disappointed in what it provides.  Out of hundreds of attempts, I've only found the Ring app to facilitate one, single successful door answer.  Even that was only accomplished as the postwoman was turning to walk away.<br><br>It's only fair to say, that my router is on the opposite side of my townhouse (and one level up) from the front door. I *did*, however drop an additional $80 to put a wifi repeater in my kitchen, so Ring had a dedicated piece of hardware that was closer, but it didn’t help much.  So my mileage may be varying.  That out of the way, here's where it's failing for me:<br><br>RINGING THE DOORBELL<br>Firstly, the delay between when a visitor presses the button outside, and when my actual indoor chime rings, is upward of 2-5 seconds.  This feels comically backward for a device that is supposed to be additive to this activity.<br><br>ANSWERING THE DOOR USING THE APP<br>The promise of answering the door with a camera feed and an intercom sounds like magic.  However upon hearing the doorbell, you have to find your phone.  Which wouldn't be that big of a deal, but answering the doorbell means:<br>Opening the app: 5-7+ seconds<br>App loads video feed: 5-20+ seconds (50% chance the video feed will be artifacted, stuttering, or even frozen)<br><br>End-to-end, my average experience takes the better part of a minute.  Which is a *long* time for someone ringing a doorbell.<br><br>VIDEO HISTORY<br>With the disappointing experience above, I didn’t subscribe to video history.  Which means that every interaction with your doorbell—which in my case statistically failed—just places an item in your video history that only links to an upsell to subscribe to video history.<br><br>Finally, upon receiving an opened package, I caved and paid for video history.<br><br>When I clicked the video history item to see if the box had been tampered with, I was led to a video that froze solid 1 second in.<br><br>The vast majority of my history feeds contain footage that didn’t even start until after a visitor had been in my doorway for several seconds, or even in the worst cases; didn’t start until they’re already gone.<br><br>While I’m happy that so many people seem to be having great experiences with Ring, at this point, I’m sitting in a meeting at work, receiving notifications of deliveries and visitors that lead to empty, artifacted videos, and the disappointment that I spent $330 (Ring + repeater) for this experience.

  I wanted to love this product, but it’s now a very expensive doorbell that only rings our phones but will not show video.  When a ring notice comes through it takes more than a min for it to connect (and only connects if we cancel the notice and manually connect to the camera).  By this time, the person at the door is long gone.  We will be moving back to a standard doorbell button.

  We got the ring doorbell to monitor the activity at our front door.....obviously.  It is great during the day and picks up all the activity I want based on the sensitivity I select but at night I can walk right in the front door without so much as a warning.  This happens at any sensitivity setting.  The night vision that is used on this camera is a joke and there is no way to disable it even if there is enough ambient light.  On the plus side the unit was easy to install and the app functions well but no being able to count on this for the most important time, night time, makes this a waste of money for me.  I would return it if I could but having installed  and used it (which is the only real way to determine how it performs) I am out of luck.  I wold personally not recommend this product until they fix this issue or allow you to turn it off in the app.

  Yes, the Ring is probably one of the most popular motion detection doorbell cameras on the market. It has great picture quality, including night vision, easy to install, wifi connectivity, etc.; however, I wish I did a little bit more homework before purchasing. I have several Nest security cameras and subscribe to their annual service which provides me with continuous recording. While I purchased the annual service from Ring, you do NOT get continuous recording...only what the device detected as motion. While I have no qualms with the Ring, I am seriously considering switching to the Nest Hello for that one reason. Don't understand why Ring can't offer the same.

  I will start by saying that the video quality  and motion detection on the Pro are excellent. I would have given this doorbell 5 stars if I did not have to pay to save the videos in the cloud after the 30 day trial period ends.. This is especially true since this is much more expensive compared with skybell  and skybell has free 7 day cloud storage. Ring could at least provide 24 hours free storage which would be adequate for most people who cannot afford to pay $30/year for cloud storage for 1 device. If you have other cameras etc the costs quickly adds up making it infeasible. I may have to switch to skybell to save on these ongoing costs. Let's see.

I really like the community feature as well, it links you to others who have the Ring doorbell and are part of the community you live in. The sensor on this thing is great, it recently sensed a baby bunny hopping in front of my porch. When my neighbor's kids ring the doorbell to see if my kids can come out to play, I don't have to run downstairs to answer the door, I just do it from my phone. Also good if you get a lot of packages delivered to your house. Honestly, these should be a staple in front of everyone's door entrance to their house, condo, or apartment.

  The product was not as simple to install as the nest products and pairing with Wi-Fi ran into issues due to coverage but that was something I solved but adding a repeater.<br>The real issue was that the product got hot (more than the 140 degrees) in July in Chicago land area. And due to this the chime would stop ringing. i opened 2 cases with support and after checking out everything transformer rating, voltage, current, wifi etc and all statuses showing green on the dashboard support monitored the device remotely and ruled it was due to temperature (no way to see the temperature on the dashboard/app). And sent me a chime doorbell as there was no fix. Temperatures have dropped since then but it doesn't matter because if there's direct sun it's going to heat the unit. What I'm not sure is what's the temperature of the board due to the software/hardware thermals.<br><br>Finally I returned the hardware back to Amazon (have to say Amazon returns and service is just excellent) and they sent me another device to rule out of it was the specific piece having issues. The new one hasn't shown any issues but I'm not sure if it's because of the outside temperature going down or if it's the device itself. Will have to wait till next summer and analyse further. But the whole experience and time spent is not something I was expecting to spend debugging a ring product that doesn't ring when the sun shines :-)

It also works well remotely from my phone. I really like the concept.<br><br>Cons: it does not stay consistently connected. I'm not sure of the down time but my guess so far is it's up 80-90% of the time and down 10-20%.

Newer houses have 3 wires but all you need is two wires one the transformer wire. The other is the wire that goes to the door bell. I used a digital meter to figure out which is which. Also my door bell is mechanical that's what is need for the Ring Pro to work right. I called Ring technical department for help to set it up.

  I don't mind playing with wires so I bought the Pro.  You increase the power fed to your front door button by wiring in a new transformer where your mechanical doorbell is (flip circuit breakers until your doorbell stops working...).  It's very, very simple and fits inside no issues.  The hardest part was getting one screw out of my old doorbell (clearly not Ring's fault).  The Ring Pro came with literally everything you need except possibly a drill (drill bits included though).  Coming with four faceplates was nice.  We ended up using a different one than originally planned so it was very nice to have several to hold up and select from.  Coupled with a wifi chime upstairs and being able to ask Alexa to display the front door on the fire tv, we have quickly become accustomed to having a Ring in the household.  We should have bought one sooner, but happy mother's day to my wife!

  Almost perfect. Install went as expected. The addtl items such as quick connect clamps, wire extensions and several colors of faceplates are exceptional value adds. The software on the Pro seems top notch and the zones you can create, set your product apart.<br>Room for improvement however is the expense of buying angled adaptors for creating an angle away from the wall when  you need to see all the way to the other side of a 4 foot door. Having to pay even extra to create an acceptable install for a top of the line product is weak point. The other weakness is the masonry bit provided is not acceptable to get job done in brick. I had to use a better bit to do a standard install in brick. With your volumes and buying power, provide a decent bit to set you apart from competitors.

  I live in a city on a busy street and have no peep hole in my front door. It was a bit unnerving opening the door not knowing who was there. The Ring Video Doorbell Pro solved that problem! I also now know when packages are delivered.<br>Easy installation took less than 30 minutes and all required tools are included in kit (unless you need to mount on concrete or similar surface in which case you need a drill - but drill bit provided!).<br>Ability to adjust motion detection area is awesome. I live on a busy street and was able to eliminate any motion of cars on the street. There is also a slider to help tune out anything but human motion.<br>You can independently switch on/off motion and ring alerts. I turned my motion alerts off because of too much foot traffic (it still records them for review later though).<br>Note that ring alerts go only to your phone - there is no actual doorbell chime unless you order a ring chime. The ring chime also extends your wireless network to provide a stronger signal to your doorbell which enhances video quality. I purchased a Ring Chime because my front door is far from my wireless router. It greatly improved doorbell performance and of course gave me the chime sound I wanted to hear in addition to my phone alert.

  The initial installation was easy and fast, and I didn't have much trouble to set it up. For the first two something weeks, it works fine, and I loved to see the doorbell alarm motion detection and I was able to see that every delivery arrives at the door. However, all of a sudden, the doorbell appears offline after a couple of weeks and it fails to reconnect to wifi what so ever. I brought Ring chime pro for a extender as the help suggests, but no luck. I brought the router next to the device, no luck. No matter how strong the signal is, the device never be able to reconnect to WiFi even after numerous factory reset. Since it already passes the return period, I have to battle to get the warranty coverage with the company (I guess Ring is now a part of Amazon).

  I have two if these ,one installed in a house is Arizona and another installed at a house in California. both of these connected to WiFi via local router connected to cable modem.  A couple of months ago had Arizona doorbell  rung, I answer it in California (on laptop connected via WiFi). The audio was so garbled I was not able to understand the person. I sent email to Ring support and we had several exchanges, first go around they said they updated the AZ ring with latest firmware.<br><br>Recently had this happen again with same results. Contacted Ring again and this time they said the internet speed was not great enough. I have cable at both houses with speed &gt;25 Mbps. I pointed out that I also have Arlo cameras at the AZ house and they worked fine. Ring's answer to that was some devices don't require as much bandwidth as Ring does (was thinking of replacing 4 Arlo cameras with Ring Spotlight cams but guess they would require even more bandwidth)<br><br>So I'm sure you have seen the commercials with a guy siting in the forest camping ( doubt there is any WiFi there so that end must be cellular)  talking to guys at his house. So bottom line by Rings own admission Ring  doorbell is limited in it's ability to communicate over networks.

The hardware works great, it comes with everything needed for installation (even with various faceplates to match your door and/or frame.<br><br>Night vision is ok, just enough to let you recognize someone.

However, the option of setting time frames in which the motion detection is off, does not work all the time.  With the option being on, there are still times in which I get motion alarms.<br><br>I was sure I did a very thorough search before buying but never bumped into (or maybe I missed it somehow...) anything that said that only for 30 days I will have free recordings and beyond that it will have to come to an expense of $ 3 per month or $ 30 a year.  Even though it is not a big deal of money, products like the ARLO camera I have, comes with free recordings (with of course up to some extent but in the end way better than this device).<br><br>Important:  If you don't have a doorbell ring with at least a 12V transformer, you will have to buy a transformer of at least 16V to install it in parallel with your doorbell (or get rid of your old doorbell if not planning to use it anymore).  The kit the product comes with is only to be used on that type of doorbell rings, in my case I choose to adapt an old Mac laptop power source (16.5 V) to make it work because I didn't have the 12V transformer type of doorbell ring.  It has been running for a week now with no power problems at all

  This is a great product but not as easy to install as you might think had to replace transformer for doorbell in basement a few bucks, had my son in-law do it as he is an electrician. Instructions are not very clear and confusing. Also remember that if you leave the app turned on on your phone it will drain it in hours and it uses your data had to add more then figured I can just turn the app off and look at it when I want. Also if you leave the app on it records everything that happens outside your door, which it does anyway even when app is off., and constantly rings your phone with a notice every time something moves. With what this costs they should give you a years for free but service after 30 days is $ 30 / year. All in all I like it and it is convenient to see who has been at my door.

  Very convenient to not have to get up and see who’s at the door. We ordered this after some items went missing from our front yard. The pro has a a great camera and matches our townhouses required color scheme with the extra face plates. This was very easy to install and it even came with all of the tools to do so. The WiFi connection is a little laggy sometimes but that’s also my home and not necessarily the doorbell. Sound is great. The only thing I’m not fond of is the motion sensor. I set the field of motion and set the sensitivity to medium. It goes of constantly with the volume of traffic on my block. It’s annoying. That being said, I don’t want to set it any lower or reduce the field because then I may miss a possible incident and that defeats the purpose of this investment. Overall I’m very happy with this doorbell.

Randomly when I'm not even by my phone or if I'm on something else and the ring picks up motion it does 2 way communications. Well, that's creepy and random neighbors sure loved hearing me scold my 2 yr old for kicking his sister. How embarrassing. I wouldn't have known if I didn't look by wondering if the motion was my amazon delivery. Now I'm just terrified it's always doing it.

  The Good: Ease of setup and installation -- it doesn't get any easier than this folks. A+<br><br>The Bad: The instructions did not mention that the internal battery needs time to charge before the system will work correctly. I was going crazy dealing with it working intermittently until I called support. Once the battery charged it worked as expected. Also, it was disappointing to find that it does not include angle mounts which I had to purchase separately. I understand not everyone needs them but it would have been nice to have during the initial installation.<br><br>The Ugly: The camera quality is poor, I mean POOR. You could never pick someone out of a lineup with these images and videos due to blurriness and lack of detail.

  I want to be able to take off for the weekend or go away on vacation and not wonder whether my absence was noticeable enough for someone to come snooping around. Of the many, many features I love about this security doorbell, being able to communicate with someone on my doorstep without them knowing whether I am in the house or across the country is the best. I chose the Ring Pro so that I wouldn't have to fuss around with recharging batteries. I contacted customer service a few times, and they could not have  been nicer or more helpful. A minor issue was quickly resolved, and my questions were answered cheerfully. Did not know when I made my purchase that Ring is developing a share program so that I can quickly share security videos with others in my neighborhood who use Ring.  This could come in handy, as there have been a few break-ins and front yard plant theft in my area. This is a really great product made by a great company.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Better motion detection and zone control,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2019","<span>
  I previously bought and installed Ring Doorbell 2 on my front door. It uses infra-red to detect motion which does not work well. Even though it gives me some basic control of the zones (in a very generic one for all arc from left to right of the view), it always picks up car movement on the street outside the zones. When a person walks to the front door and stays in the middle of the camera view, his motion won't get picked up until very close (It works better if he walks from left or right to the center of camera view). And the video capture always starts after motion was detected, which may loses few earlier seconds. For instance, a delivery guy left the package on my front porch, video only shows him dropped the package and leaving, but did not show him approaching front door. All these problems are fixed in Ring Doorbell Pro, which detects motion using software to compare consecutive video images. It uses picture taken from the camera to allow you to customize multiple zones you want to watch and exclude other areas in the view. This is more accurate. I also like the fact that the video capture always starts few seconds earlier before the person enters the detection zones. I now moved my old Ring Door Bell 2 to the backyard door which has no doorbell wiring, so it is actually an advantage since it can run on battery.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for monitoring front door area quickly & easily!,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2017","<span>
  Love this doorbell! I installed it, yes it was super easy. I needed a way to monitor our front door as we receive packages and ship packages (due to home based business) daily. In addition, we have 3 kids and its so great now seeing when they come/go and knowing that even when we are out. The first night of having this, my husband and I were at a dinner and it was awesome because my phone alerted me when my son got home. And I could see when his friend arrived as well LOL.  They were both pointing and staring at the doorbell - having no idea I could see them right then - it was funny.  Its been so nice also being in kitchen and having my iPad/iPhone alter when there is movement on front porch and we can see what's going on and not rush to door if its a solicitor. What I also like is there is hardly a delay in live movement vs what you see on camera - we tried another popular security camera system first, but there were several seconds delay, so by the time I got my phone out with alert, the person at front was already gone and so camera didn't catch the quick movement. With this Ring Pro, the zone is wide enough that it sees the street so as soon as car pulls up, it alerts me, and so by the time I open my phone, I see the person just walking up - its hardly a delay at all. Very, very happy - didn't know I would love this so much. My only complaint is that you have to pay for cloud storage...I would rather store on my own hard drive. But that's okay, its only $30/year- the doorbell has come in way more handy than I imagined.

  We had the original ring doorbell at our old house and when we moved we saw that there was an upgraded version.  This one is really nice because it comes with a face plate in four different colors and is smaller than the original.  We liked the darker bronze to match our home rather than the original silver color.  if we happen to paint our house  and one of the other colors would match better it's simply a matter of changing out the faceplate to one that's more suitable .  The other one was battery-operated and this one is hardwired to your home, we like this option because we don't have to deal with batteries anymore.  We also have the portable chime (I recommend it if you have a large house or multiple stories) that we put in the back of the house so that I don't miss anyone coming to the door.  It's really nice to be able to see if a package has been delivered or if someone has approached your home while you're gone (using their app) and the ability to communicate with them in real time is extremely beneficial.  You don't have to have the recordings on the cloud but it's only $30 a year which for us made sense to keep it on the cloud.

  We have been thrilled with our Ring Pro. The picture is actually pretty good, even at night. It’s nice to be able to see who’s at the door before answering it and I feel it’s a deterrent to any kind of trouble because people know what it is. You can easy set the Ring to record a short video any time motion is detected. You do need to play with the motion sensitivity though, because it can be triggered by passing cars if the sensitivity isn’t adjusted (but this is easy to do). I also like that I can get the activity alerts on my phone, so I know when packages have been delivered or when kids get home from school when I’m not home. The only thing I don’t like is the slight delay between when the doorbell is rung and when it sounds inside. Definitely a minor thing, but noticed. I recommend The Ring to anyone thinking about it and encouraged my parents to get one for added security it provides.

  After reading lots of video doorbell reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I settled on the Ring Pro product. I have an existing doorbell, so the wiring the would allow me to power the Ring doorbell was in place. I connected the wires from the Ring doorbell to a 24V transformer, and didn't bother trying to integrate with an existing electromechanical or other chime.<br><br>My main issue with the Ring product is with the WiFi implementation. I have a large house, and because of this I have three separate WiFi access points which all broadcast the same SSID. Much to my surprise and chagrin, the Ring doorbell doesn't automatically select the strongest WiFi signal - in fact, it often seemed to be trying to select the weakest one. To solve this problem, I placed an access point in the bedroom above my front door and disabled my other access points so that the Ring doorbell would see only one signal, the strongest one.  Then I re-enabled the other access points and prayed that a power outage wouldn't cause things to foul up again. I did all this to get the system working on the 2.4 GHz band.  The 5 GHz band is basically useless, as the Ring has trouble connecting at that frequency to even the closest access point!<br><br>Every WiFi client device I have is able to automatically select the strongest signal it sees. I don't understand why the Ring doorbell doesn't seem to be able to do this.<br><br>Another issue I have is with the Ring Chime. I thought this was a great little device - it sits on the WiFi network and generates an audible chime when it receives a message from the doorbell, either when there is motion near the doorbell or when the button is pushed. This eliminates the need for an old-fashioned electromechanical chime, and allows a great deal of flexibility on where the chime is placed. Took me only 5 minutes to install a chime in my downstairs hallway.  Everything was working fine!  However, as I mentioned above, I have a large house, so I decided to add a chime on my lower level and also upstairs near the master bedroom.  This is where the trouble began.  I purchased two more Ring Chimes from Amazon, but couldn't get either of them to connect to my WiFi network.  After spending an hour on the phone with customer service, I ended up returning both Chimes to Amazon. The customer service person said they might both be bad, though I doubted that.  I then purchased two more Ring Chimes from my local Best Buy, hoping that my earlier devices were part of a bad batch.  SAME PROBLEM! Neither of the newer chimes would connect to my network. I tried several fixes: I disabled all but one of my access points; I removed the first, working chime from the network and tried to substitute one of the new ones; NO LUCK.  Fortunately, I was able to get the original chime to work again. The Best Buy items will be returned tomorrow. It is hard to believe that these products could perform so poorly!<br><br>I purchased and tried one other product in the Ring family - the Ring Pro Chime. This device serves as both a chime and a network extender, so I figured I would put this device near the master bedroom to both receive the doorbell signals and provide a stronger WiFi signal in the bedroom. The device worked as a chime, but it is not designed to be a general-purpose network extender. It is designed only to extend the existing WiFi network to the doorbell, but with a different SSID. Also, it doesn't operate at 5 GHz. Based on all of this, the Ring Pro Chime was of no use to me, so this item went back to Ring - I purchased it directly from them.<br><br>Overall, the Ring product line shows great promise, and can be of tremendous benefit when it works. Hopefully the company can release updated software that makes the WiFi operation more robust, and can cure whatever the issue is with Ring Chime. It is frustrating that a product so slickly packaged and marketed should have such a glaring Achilles heel.

That's pretty silly, I wish I could save the videos to my computer without the need to have yet another yearly subscription.

  Honestly I have only had installed for 24 hours but I love. This is hard wired installed so I do not have to worry about batteries. It came with wedges I needed. I installed on brick and they included the drill bit but I had to use my own drill ;-). Included screws and wire extenders. I thought installment was pretty simple, directions easy to follow. So far the APP works perfectly and you can connect to neighborhood chat if you choose. Night vision good. My teenagers accuse me of spying on them and I told them it’s not that hard just use a different door if you don’t want to be seen on the camera. LOL!

  I originally purchased this in October. At the time, it was not clear anywhere I looked that a significant requirement for this product was a broadband service with at least 1 MBit upload speed. Probably because, these days that is pretty slow for anyone who has broadband. Sadly, thanks to the backwards thinking of Qwest 25 years ago, I live in an area where there is only one broadband provider (Comcast/Xfinity). Horror stories had kept me away from cable, so I had been suffering with archaic DSL. After installing the Doorbell, I found out Centurylink had throttled my DSL to even slower speeds and 1 MBit would never happen.<br>Fast forward to beginning of February after I got Xfinity installed (100 MBit down, 5 MBit up). (I will attempt to compress a myriad of e-mails into a paragraph.)<br>Basically, the device would ""crash"" after 10 to 15 minutes. By crash, I mean in the nightmarish sense that only an embedded developer could appreciate. It became completely unresponsive. Eventually, I was told that if you hold the setup button long enough the device would reboot. The tech support people did not know that, they thought holding that button would cause a factory reset. Mostly it would reboot, but a great deal of the time, the only way I could get it to work again was to unscrew off the door frame and disconnect the power! In February, I did that dozens of times.<br><br>The silliest point was when they asked for pictures of the doorbell and its transformer. Then I was told that my 16 VAC transformer might not supply adequate voltage (keeping in mind the status device health screen never indicated this), and that I should consider installing a 20 VAC transformer. At that point I connected a Fluke DVM to the device for a couple hours one evening as it crashed and rebooted a few times and demonstrated the voltage at the device was never below 17 VAC. That led to a tier 2 status which entailed a phone call with someone from Ring. This guy was nice and knowledgeable, but the day of the call, the device received a firmware update and worked perfectly for 30 minutes (a record at that point). We ended the call and I waited for an email closing the trouble ticket. It worked for about an hour. When I e-mailed them again. They FINALLY, after I had asked many, many times, agreed to send a replacement.<br><br>As I am writing this, the new unit has been up for almost 2 whole hours (woo hoooo!).  I am hopeful.<br><br>Ring really needs to pull their head out when dealing with tech savvy users and admit defeat when a unit is as screwed up as my first one. I should not have had to wait this long to get a replacement unit.<br><br>Finally, as a technical aside, the first device would fail with absolutely no input. No events were needed, it would just crash. To speed up my process of catching this, rather than continually turning on live view or ringing the doorbell, I wrote a bash script to ping the device every second and dump out a message if it ever failed.

  The installation can be challenging based upon your current doorbell location and the material of your outside wall. The wire connectors that need to be used to extend the length of the door bell wires to attach to the RING unit are bulky and need to be tucked in the wall. My wall was brick and I had to carefully chisel a larger hole, being sure not to exceed dimensions of RING unit to cover hole. The LIVE VIEW video does not work flawlessly for me but the measure of security that I've gained makes me still a satisfied customer. The motion alert notification and video recording feature is especially good, you know if someone even approaches your door and if they delay ringing your bell you already know they are there. So if someone is trying to hide from view, maybe a second suspect, you see them both on video first and call 911 and not answer the door.

  Installation was a breeze. Just read and follow along with their little pamphlets. Nice touch providing drill bit, screwdrivers and wall level plate especially. The whole process took less than 30minutes after having first read everything.<br>The app works well. Be patient finding the sweet spot for motion area and sensitivity.<br>My only gripe: charging $30 for cloud storage is a bit diabolical in today’s world. There are competitor products that do the same and don’t charge. Fortunately for Ring there are none I’m aware of that have such a small footprint for their ringer and so they got me for their dastardly fee.<br>Hopefully as competitors expand they’ll be forced to drop it.

  Let's get this out of the way first: I would recommend this product.<br><br>When we first got this device I was not happy at all. The video playback was very jerky, had pixelation, and poor quality all around. I got a range extender but still no joy. At this point I would have given it about a -1 star.<br><br>What I found out later was this model (1080p) has a recommendation of 2mbps upload speed MINIMUM. I don't recall ever seeing that in any documentation before buying it. After I checked ours I found 1.4 was the best I was getting. We suffered through this for a while until I could get my internet package upgraded. It costs me another $10 USD a month but now it works great (and overall internet experience is better also :-) ). One of the reasons for going with this model was the Live Video. Works great now. Now that the upload speed issue has been resolved my wife and I are really happy with it.<br><br>The voice, talking back and forth with person at door, has worked well the few times I used it. My son locked himself out of the house while we were at work. He thought I was working at home. We were able to communicate just fine. The setting of the ""zones"" for motion and sensitivity is easy to set up. Getting it working on our iPhone was easy. The app walked me through the entire process and the written instructions were easy to follow.<br><br>We do have the occasional ""false"" alert. This happens mainly at night when the neighbors are driving in and out and their headlights shine under the stoop. Lightening has set it off also. Obviously it is light sensitive. This is a minor annoyance and would not stop me from recommending it.<br><br>I researched comparable devices. What sold me on Ring was the $3/month for cloud video storage. There are other products that do similar things for less, but they charge more for the cloud storage. Or you have to have some other hardware to store the video. I have a friend who has some cameras set up at his house, no video storage, and he was impressed with the Ring Doorbell.<br><br>In parting, if you are thinking about getting this product make sure you have, or can get, the minimum 2mbps upload speed. If not, then don't get this device. Get the 780p one instead. A work colleague has the 780p model and he likes it.

  We purchased the Door Bell 2 unit back last July (18), and it worked just fine till about 3 months ago, when it started dropping the WiFi, which caused it to not work.  The only way I could ""solve"" this was to switch the circuit and cause a power-cycle on the unit.  Then it would work great again for a few days, then I would have to do this over again.  I finally contacted support via email (they were fairly responsive for email), and after exchanging back-and-forth, they sent me a 16v 30va transformer.  After installing this, it actually worked worse (I had a 16v 10va - which is suppose to work with this), but I had to by-pass my mechanical existing door bell as I received a low power error in the amp.  The by-pass was easy enough as the Ring receiver (the little white box), had this functional incorporated and just had to remove the sticker.  Once I did this, it did create a problem as the mechanical doorbell would no longer work, so if you were not by a phone with the app, you would not hear the doorbell.  And after all that it was still dropping the WiFi.  So I ended up getting the WiFi extender with the built-in speaker, more to hear the doorbell then as a WiFi extender, I put this on an outlet maybe 3 feet from the doorbell, and that seemed to fix everything.  Why it worked for months and months without any issues is unknown, but maybe there is some crazy WiFi deadspot by the Ring.  My routers is literally 10 feet away from it.<br><br>The other thing I wanted to mention is the button on the doorbell has developed a crack on it.  I mention this as two of my other neighbors that have Ring have the same issue.  Just not built that strong and kids have to push it really hard.  I put some epoxy on it, and although noticeable, it is not growing, so just be aware.

My son explained all the features and showed me how the video worked. He showed me how to set up the perimeters for the motion.  I then  bought one for my daughter and son in law before getting my own as a Christmas gift.  My experience was not as easy as my kids.<br>The day my son came to install it was exceptionally cold and the doorbell would not work. He checked the voltage, it was fine.He took it out and reinstalled it, still nothing.  He called the help line and even though he knew how to install it, he went through the process with the woman on line.It continued to not work. Was it the cold or a faulty doorbell?<br> He mailed it back and we received a new one. This one does work so I am happy. However  if you have a slow internet, then the video will be slow. Not the fault of the doorbell for sure. I feel more secure now knowing I don't have to open my door to strangers. I  just have to remember not to run to the door!

  I'm really impressed with this device. It's not ""easy"" to install compared to a battery-operated version that you just glue to the wall but is as easy as it could possibly be to install given the legacy wiring and doorbell transformers one has to deal with. It came with really clever packaging, all the parts and tools you need (literally; it comes with a screw driver), and clear instructions. I had a Heath Zenith doorbell running at 16v AC and an EERO wifi router that is 50' away from the front door. It all powered up, connected, and streamed video with no hitches outside of some annoying bugs in their app (please fix the wifi password workflow so I can use lastpass!).

  The ring does most of what it's supposed to do.  It does record video of whomever is at the door.  It does ring the doorbell.  However, connecting to it and interacting with someone who is actually at the door is unreliable at best.<br><br>The app does say that the ring has an RSSI (Received Signal Strength) of 58, which is indicative of moderate ""WiFi interference"".  The ring is on the first floor while the WiFi router is on the second floor and approximately 18ft away.  Granted the signal does have to traverse the hardwood floors and subfloor to get to the ring, but it did work fine before a software upgrade.<br><br>Bottom line, it does do what it's supposed to do, however, the functionality is limited barring the addition of the ring signal extender.

  After two replacement devices, I finally got my Ring Pro working consistently. The first two devices I had kept going offline and wouldn't enter setup mode to connect them back to my home WiFi. Ring support was kind enough to send me a transformer to see if that resolved my issue. Unfortunately, it did not. My third device now works as expected. I've only noticed it go offline a few times, but only for a short time (merely seconds) before going back online without intervention. The video quality is pretty good. The sound quality could be better. The customization settings are superior to that of another video doorbell I'd been trying out alongside my Ring Pro. However, even with the customizable Motion Zones, I still get quite a few motion alerts. For instance, when a lightweight flag is blowing that I've excluded from my set Motion Zones, I still receive motion alerts only to find that no one is there - just a flag that's blowing in the breeze. My best advice: find your doorbell transformer before installation and ensure that it provides adequate power. If it doesn't, order one that does. I'm not saying that installing the Ring transformer was the answer to my problem, but that's one of the first troubleshooting steps that support will discuss with you.

  .  As far as the transformer I ordered -- yes, it is different from the picture, it arrived in a padded envelope and the mounting tabs were bent as a result.  It was exactly what I needed, however and made a BIG difference.<br><br>I have a custom firewall that I have limiting my incoming and outgoing traffic.  I saw some reviews and posts worried about the firewall ports listed on the Ring support site.  Some people thought they had to basically open all of the ports in their firewall to get this to work.  That is not true at all in my experience.  I opened the outgoing ports only (my firewall is stateful so it allows associated connections back in without explicitly having to open them). Everything worked fine afterwards.<br><br>Here is a BIG performance hint:  I have tried accessing my Ring from several other Wifi networks.  Most of them seem to not allow all of the correct outgoing ports.  Turning off Wifi and only using the 4G network, however, works 100% of the time.  I have never had a failure to connect using this method.<br><br>I plan on getting some more Ring video products in the very near future.

  Love the Ring Doorbell Pro. We had wanted one for some time, saw a price break on Amazon and purchased. Out of the box, I was able to hook up the inside doorbell booster in about 5 minutes and I watched the video twice to do it right. Before drilling and replacing the old outdoor doorbell, turn off the power. It took me 5 minutes to find the right breaker. Once I had the front door power off, I had to use my own brick drill bit as the one they supplied wore down during the 1st drill hole. Drilling and setting it up took me about 5 minutes, it was easy to attach. Using the app is the easiest part. I like the motion zones I can set up, live video, and how it answers the doorbell or motion straight to the phone. I can confirm the Ring Doorbell and Ring App work while you are in a foreign country - it was as if we were in the next room. We do have a slight chime delay inside the house, but hardly any delay on the phone/device. We used the 30 day free trial of cloud storage of video, and just subscribed for the year for only $30 per doorbell or camera. At Christmas we intend to get the Stick Up Camera for the backyard.

Its literally a sci-fi-esque video phone for your door.<br><br>The only limitations is that the tech is not quite there for complete smooth awesome slickness.  The Doorbell chimes outside followed by inside chime followed by the mechanical chime followed by a push notification on my phone...All told maybe 5 seconds.  Than I open the app turn on the camera turn on the sound and press the speak button.  It has taken me 30 seconds to let my visitor know I am coming to answer the door.  Not bad...just sluggish and not slick.  Despite that its a huge improvement of me heading up the stairs and often missing them because they have assumed I am not home when I arrive.<br><br>I like turning on live view to check on the goings on outside, or check the weather quickly.  I look forward to being able to wave off solicitors without having to stop watching my show and make my way up the stairs.<br><br>Another great thing about this product is the sense of security it gives me.

  They would get five stars if they would make good on the HomeKit integration they promise.  It’s a great product, great instructions, reliable, etc.  However, I have my entire house in HomeKit...  oh except this device.  Ring...  please release HomeKit integration.  Your app is good enough that I will still use it for many reasons including the neighbor video sharing, but enabling the ability to automate based on the Ring device status and integration to the HomeKit user interface environment would make me very happy.  I am wanting to buy security cams, and really want Ring cams, but am currently stuck in indecision without HomeKit integration.  If you are not going to do HomeKit, then at least tell us so we can make a decision to use Ring without integration or use something else that is HomeKit compatible.  Just saying ‘coming soon’ for so long is not showing respect for your customers and I don’t want to buy more on a promise that is starting to feel like it will be broken.  Make no mistake, I bought your product because it is excellent, AND because you said it will have HomeKit integration.  Can you please let us know if this is still going to happen and when?

  I purchased the Ring Doorbell Pro in December 2017, and everything from installation to the app was awesome; until it suddenly stopped working a few days ago.  I contacted Ring Community Support and since my system was still under warranty I believed they would rectify the issue.  They did not.  The solutions the Ring representative suggested were not on point and had I followed those suggestions I would have wasted a lot of time and money chasing down wiring that was suggested was defective (it was not) and replacing my indoor digital chime that was suggested may be defective (it was not).  I wound up purchasing another Ring Doorbell Pro to replace the outside doorbell (push button doorbell/camera) of the Ring system.  I spent a lot of money to make the system operational again even though it was still supposed to be under warranty.  If the system malfunctions again I will give serious thought to a different manufacturer.  Support after the sale used to be important and for me it still is.

  A great product and awesome customer service, I will be buying more of their products<br>UPDATE I have had the Ring Pro for 3 weeks now and its been working perfectly, I really like not having to worry about the power supply.  The picture quality is great and even the night vision is adequate to see whos there. Be warned you will now know whenever there is activity at your front door you have a recording every time someones in or out of your front door and that takes getting used to. On a  lighter note, there are few things in life more gratifying the being able to flash your wife from the door bell.  I am definitely getting more of their products especially the flood lights.

  This is an update to my previous review. Customer service reached out to me and spent considerable time on the phone with me. The end result? Turns out the issue was the feature of full screen pop up video when bell is rung is no longer available. It has been replaced with ""preview tiles"" and a pop up notification alert on the phone. pressing the alert takes you to the preview, where you can choose to answer or not.  As for the lagging issues there will be a 3-10 second pause before chime and app both ring, which is considered normal and frankly I can live with that.<br>Overall I'm happy with the product and intend on remaining a Ring fan. I only gave it four stars this time just because of the pop up video feature.<br>I felt the level of sincerity and urgency to resolve the issue was genuine. Thank you Jason and especially Cyndi.

  The first ring doorbell pro I received would not even turn on.  I was super frustrated about this thinking I had the wiring wrong even though I had the recommended power requirements. Found out it was a dud and ended up getting a replacement and didn’t want to chance it.  Bought a new transformer on amazon, 16V 30vac, and installed that to ensure more than enough power.  Ring pro turned on as soon as I turned the power back on, yay!<br><br>They really need to advertise the type of transformer you should have instead of the recommended power requirements.  My return is also not showing on amazon even though it shows on USPS tracking as received so hoping I don’t get double charged.<br><br>Overall, bad first experience with the dud.

  The Ring doorbell is a necessary item and one that works fairly well. The only problem is the video delay. A prime example is, if I get an Amazon delivery, and the delivery person rings the doorbell and walks away, by the time the Ring video resolves so that I can see who it is, the person is in the truck and driving away. It takes too long to actually see the person. I know that it is not my wi-fi because I purposely bought an extender to prevent this from happening. Yes, it is a good tool for the home, but I should have done more research on other systems and done a more in-depth comparison.

  After multiple hours of research between RING and its competitors I decided to go with the RING video doorbell pro.  It was super easy to setup and install even with my door trim being very thin.  Impressed by the features and quality, I went out and bought two WIFI/Wireless RING spotlight cameras.  These also were mounted and installed very easy.  Do yourself a favor and buy an extra battery for each spotlight camera.  They have the ability to accept two batteries, but only come with one.  The battery life is amazing and we have a lot of motion and alerts.  All in all RING makes a great product that anyone can setup and install.  You don't have to be a technical guru to get up and running.<br><br>All the tools and accessories you need are included in the packaging.  This includes screwdriver, screws, mounts, etc.  I am 110% satisfied with my purchase(s) and have been telling everyone about RING and their line of great products.

  Long term (2-year) review summary - Perhaps the most disappointing purchase ever. Hard-wired installation, which was easy enough. This thing never worked very well, and it would become disconnected from the network every month or so, with manual re-connection required. Within a year, it would drop the network and only reconnect for a few minutes at a time. It's under a covered porch and while outside, not exposed to direct precipitation. Very, very disappointed in the long-term reliability and functionality of this item, and frankly, with every Ring system purchase I made. I bought the Chime Pro at the same time as the Doorbell Pro and that thing never worked right either. Where's the negative star option? And if you think the positive reviews tell the tale, I encourage you to see how many are from verified buyers. An expensive roll of the dice, but never again. Fool me once...

  I love my Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  I consider myself a pretty advanced IT person when it comes to computers and the installation instructions for the doorbell was pretty easy to follow.  It only took me about 30 minutes.  I was able to install the power kit on the chime and easily swap out the old doorbell for this new one.  I have an iPhone so I used the free app to connect and modify the doorbell settings.  I was good to go in a manner of minutes.  I'm really happy with the options, the way it works, the clarity of the videos and have owned it for many months now.  I haven't had a single problem.<br><br>I love:<br>* The accompanying Chime accessory that allows me to pick a custom ring tone for the doorbell and I'm glad I don't have to keep my phone handy to know when the doorbell has rung.<br>* The app on my iPhone, the notifications and ability to answer the door through my phone<br>* The video quality, it's really clear to me even at night when no lights are on outside<br>* Ring's ability to share video with your neighbors that also use Ring devices.  That's a great sense of community.<br><br>What I don't love:<br>* I get a notification that someone just rung my doorbell and I'm not fast enough to unlock my phone and open my app to start streaming the video.  Many times I'd love to be able to shock the FedEx guy and tell him 'thank you' for putting my packages nicely on the door or hiding it for me out of view but alas he is too fast.<br>* I think the doorbell will show a blue ring when you're live viewing which is an indication to someone at the front door that you're watching?  I'm not 100% sure about this but once I had a solicitor come to the door and when I was viewing he was waving his arms around like ""I'm here, come talk to me"".  I hung up on his ass.<br><br>I've seen a few other reviews here and if you're considering purchasing this doorbell for yourself I have some advice:<br>1)  Make sure this doorbell is going to be compatible with the wiring you have.  Generally that's not a big deal, it's a few wires.<br>2)  Install the power kit - this is a small kit that comes with the doorbell to make sure enough power is being sent to the doorbell unit itself so you don't have to use batteries.  Why put trust in security to something that runs on batteries?<br>3)  Find out how good your wifi coverage is at your front door before you consider buying this.  Do you have a weak signal?  That may cause problems for the doorbell to be an effective tool for you.  Weak signal?  No problem, get yourself a wifi range extender to make sure you get full bars at the front door.<br>4)  Wifi coverage is great, but what about saturation?  Do all your neighbors have wifi, live in close proximity and likely have the same service like AT&amp;T UVerse that gives you a wifi modem with your service?  Generally that means that all your neighbors are fighting to use the same if not similar channel settings for wifi.  This could cause issues where your wifi cuts out.  Most of the time this won't matter if you have great coverage, but it is a consideration.  Have you had other wifi problems with your phone or computer?  Then you may have similar issues with your doorbell.  Just be aware and what you can do to fix it.  For saturation, you'd have to modify your router to choose a channel for your wifi that perhaps your neighbors are not using (ask a great IT friend to check out your wifi for you if you're stuck - I'm on a Mac and love the program iStumbler for just this purpose).<br>5) If everything else works out, then make sure when you install your doorbell that the wires are clean and still seem reliable.  Be sure to tighten those wire connectors pretty good.<br><br>I'm sure everybody has experienced a product that is dead on arrival, but I feel a lot of people that review negatively may have other issues with their installation or wifi that may be preventing them from really enjoying this product like I do.

I wasn't looking for anything special but after the 30 days runs out all of a sudden the alerts give you the feeling of ""Oh I just missed whatever just happened"" because you only get real time video unless you pay $3 a month for the ring service.  So I would get an alert saying someone was at my front door.  Click the App, and the person would already be gone and I would have no way of seeing anything.

  With all of the package thieves out there, we decided to install a doorbell camera.  We first purchased a doorbell camera from the security company that monitors our alarm.  Two technicians tried to get it to work but the audio worked on and off, mostly off.  We finally had a third technician come and remove it.  The third ""technician"" showed us his Ring doorbell that he has installed in his home on his phone and it worked flawlessly so we ordered one.  I installed it in less than 15 minutes and had it programmed to our phones in no time at all.  Haven't had a single problem with the audio or visual.  Would highly recommend.

  After a rough start up period, I now have the doorbell working and it's a great addition to my home.<br><br>When I first got the unit, I installed it and it worked fine.  1 week into it, it stopped working completely.  I called up and was told the transformer I had was not powerful enough and to buy a new 24 volt one instead of the 16 volt one I had.  I did this, spent the $15, and it still did not work.  I called back up and was then told the 16 volt transformer was fine, and that there was a known issue with the Ring Power box, and a replacement would be sent out to me, along with a free ring chime.  This took about 4 weeks to get, as the new Ring power cable was on back order.  When I finally got it, it worked fine, but what was not told to me was that I could no longer use the doorbell chime I had, and I could only use the ring chime.  This was quite frustrating, but honestly in the end I prefer the Ring Chime, but I wasn't told I'd have no choice, as my custom ring chime kit that I previously used was not little more than trash.<br><br>Now that I have the unit, I love the notifications of movement, the UPS drivers and USPS don't ring the bell, they just drop off packages, and now I know when they arrived.  The unit is helpful on so many levels I can't go into them all, but I do love it.<br><br>And now the cons...  I have my lights set to turn off at midnight outside, and one is right above the door.  Each night at midnight I hear a motion alert noise when the light turns off.  Occasionally I hear one at 3 AM if a bird flies in.  The solution is to turn off motion (I have one chime in the bedroom and one in the kitchen), but I hate to do that, but might have to.<br><br>Bottom line, great device, I wish it could do custom rings, and turn off motion alerts on some chime only during specified hours, but I'm told those items are being worked on.

  The ring doorbell pro works great  but it was a pain in the butt to get it hooked up. I had to change my transformer in the house and then it took multiple calls to customer service. I must say the customer services beyond quality. They sent me a ring chime pro wi-Fi extender for free just to make sure that I had a A+ quality experience with their product .  The ring chime pro is an excellent product easy to set up works great. I just wish they offered more distinct ringtones for this product. Maybe something like an alarm sound off of a submarine or maybe a customizable ringtone  that you can download and or install into it from your phone or PC .  There are some improvements that could be made to the app. It doesn't function very well with an older iPhone 5. It seems to have the video be laggy and pixelated. But on newer phones the video quality is excellent.  But overall I would give the product a 10 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone .

  Update: After 18 months the Ring and stick up cam no longer work. Their servers are TOO SLOW and because of this I miss doorbell rings and activity. On average it takes 30+ seconds for the Ring App to open and at least as long for it to open video feed. Ring refuses to accept responsibility for their horrifically slow servers and blames my ISP/router/network. Which I find amusing as I have typically 350kb at the Ring. One tech even remarked he was surprised by the amount of bandwidth I have. Their support folks work hard and mean well but when the backbone of their service (servers) is that bad I can’t stay with Ring.<br><br>Sorry, but I’ve dumped Ring for Nest. It was great for the first 6-8 months but the progressive worsening of the service caused me to move on.<br><br>Decent clear video out to about 25 ft. Motion detection is fair but can be intermittent. Sometimes it's too sensitive other times a freight train could run through the motion zones and not trigger an alert. Head lights on a car will set it off in the middle of the night. It is a power hog. Burned up two doorbell transformers. Put a heavy duty plug in model and even it is taxed. Hopefully it will last. UI is meh. I wish the video would record continuously like Nest.<br><br>Overall it's a decent product that could be AWESOME.

  Installed my Ring Pro last week and have been very happy with it since. I needed to find and separately order the angle shim brackets to fit my corner application, but these also worked well.<br><br>My only criticism is that the documentation for the installation process needs more work. They spend too much time talking about different versions of their product and not enough time explaining different installation scenarios.  The different version issue shouldn't be the consumers problem and Ring should produce separate videos for each one to eliminate this confusion.<br><br>The documentation and video for the Ring Pro says that this product requires an existing doorbell and only describes how to connect it to your existing doorbell. I had a doorbell wire but didn't have or want to buy an old fashioned doorbell just to connect my Ring. After spending way too much time searching their website, I finally found some sketchy information on connecting the Ring Pro to a small transformer (readily available on Amazon) and bypassing the need for a conventional doorbell entirely. I was able to complete the installation but would've been much happier if the documentation and video had mentioned this option.<br><br>My last bit of feedback is that the website needs to be reoganized to do a better job comparing the two products (Ring and Ring Pro) and explaining the pros and cons of each.  They tell you that the Ring is battery operated and Ring Pro is wired, but don't tell you whether they are otherwise identical or different. From doing a lot of googling, I eventually inferred but still am not completely sure that the motion sensing and cameras have different capabilities between the two products.  I bought the ""Pro"" version mostly because I assumed it would be better, but I would've much more confident and happier if they had made this easy by explaining the differences on their website.<br><br>Overall, after getting over the installation hurdles, I'm really happy with the result. It's a major game changer and Ring is a great product. Buy one.

  The idea is great but the execution is pretty weak. My three main issues:<br><br>1. I know they're trying to keep the device as sleek as possible, but there is zero space on the back side of the device to stick some of the wiring in. If your wiring to your existing doorbell is already pushed into the wall/door frame as much as it can be, you'll have problems.<br><br>2. This is a common issues based on what I've seen on the support forums, the device fails to switch back to full color during daylight hours. My front door is shaded, but far from dark, and it is in night vision mode about 75% of the time during the day.<br><br>3. Last but not least, the app is fairly slow and clunky.

My husband figured out how to install it, along with the help of Ring customer service, and BINGO! WE LOVE the Ring Video Doorbell Pro. Earlier this year (February, 2018), we had an unknown man come to our door late at night. He wanted us to let him in, as he was looking for a friend. Through the doorbell system, we were able to tell him he had the wrong house, and that we wouldn't open the door.  Long story short, the man went to the house next door, and proceeded to break in and burglarize the house. We called the police, and they have a copy of our Ring Video. Charges were filed, etc.  We are very thankful for our Ring Video Doorbell Pro! We have now ordered the Ring Floodlight Cam, Motion-Activated HD Security Camera with Built-In Floodlights, A Siren Alarm and Two-Way Talk.

My issue is when I received this item it looked as in the actual box had been opened and fingerprints were on the lenses. I took pictures in case of any issues and continued with installation since I had help at that time (usually an easy process, but my house required newer wiring etc.).

  I've had it for about 6 weeks and I do think it's a great idea. I gave it 4 out of 5 because of the software. It needs a little work but once that's done it will be a 5 star. I am part of the improvement program and maybe my input will help. I like the adjustable motion zones you can custom mark the areas you want covered . I have some false motion alarms but I think it's because of the approaching cars but not too bad. There is a delay in the sound and sometimes at night it has a delay before the night vision turns on. Also, sometimes when the doorbell is pressed, it does not ring. I will be calling to see if that's a problem. I think it's great that I can tell the Fedex delivery guy where to put my package if he rings the doorbell and I get a good face pic. Overall, it's a winner. I had to replace my chime but no big deal. Installation is easy and they supply the tools needed if you don't have your own. One thing impressed me even though it was small. They give you extra screws because I think they know you will drop one. I also thing they are interested in feedback to make a better product. So many vendors don't give a damn what customers have to say as long as there making money. That kind of thinking is important to me. I will update my review as I get more experience with my product. So far, so good and I recommend this Ring Pro.

  In theory this product is awesome. I loved it for several months. However, for the last couple of months, the live view hasn’t been working. The device seems to not function very well in the cold. I contact Ring support which asks me to disconnect and then reconnect it. Device functions normally for a few days and then goes back to the same problems. 4/7/19 Update: I contacted Ring again and they have sent me a new device free of charge. With this I’m changing my rating from 1 to 4 stars due to Ring’s good customer service and willingness to get me a new doorbell.

  Got our new ring doorbell installed in maybe an hour and have to say it’s pretty cool.  The tough part for me was the wiring in our house.  We have Cat 5 and not the traditional doorbell wiring, so didn’t know if it was gonna work and was bummed at first.  When I took my old doorbell chime off the wall I discovered this.  Also, to date haven’t found our doorbell transformer.  I tested the voltage at the doorbell push button and was getting 20v so didn’t use the provided power pack.  Getting connected to my WiFi took a little bit of massaging but finally it connected to my extended and works like a charm, shows strong signal.  I didn’t try to reinstall my old chime due to how it was wired so I added on the ring chime and that was super easy to setup.  We also like using the app to see videos posted from people in the area and this is a good tool for people to keep crime down.

  Good thing for YouTube when you need help to figure out how to install, troubleshoot, and operate things that you buy on Amazon because much of the time the provided instructions are vague or non-existent.  I did not know that you need to download the Alexa App on your smartphone before you can give new skills (Ring and Smart Devices).  It's not clear on the Echo Show and you are expected to know how to do these things :-(  Any way I have figured it all out and now I can control all my Ring Cameras/Lights, and TP-Link Smart Plugs/Switches from the Echo Show besides all the other neat stuff that this device can do.

  Very good picture and voice quality locally over local WiFi.  I don't expect it to be stellar over cellular when away from home but that's a cell coverage and bandwidth issue.  The interface of the app is slightly confusing and could be more intuitive.  Also there were a couple of times where I got the motion alert, but I could not find the corresponding video.  Ring should offer a continuous recording option in their plans.  Finally, I think Ring should add a timestamp overlay to the videos.  I should also mention that I have been wanting a Ring Doorbell for a long time, but had been dreading the installation.  I am pleased to report that it was much easier than I thought, and I had it up and running within 20 minutes.

I was so impressed, I ordered Flood Light Cameras for around my home for a more complete security package.  There is no additional charge for adding these additional cameras to your recording package.  $100 per year for all of your recordings at your fingertips.  Well worth it.

The Ring solution is much better for a fraction of the cost.

  I can only comment on the installation process and it ended up with me returning the product.  The bit that comes in the package is good for concrete and masonry, but you need a hammer drill to make this work.  Spent 45 mins trying it with a regular drill and got about 1/2 inch into the brick.  You need the right tools.  Second issue is the voltage.  This unit needs at least 16 VAC to power the electronics.  Turns out my existing doorbell transformer only puts out 10 to 11 VAC; and since we finished the basement a few years back, the transformer is likely behind sheetrock somewhere; so i can't replace it.  Lesson learned is educate yourself on how this thing has to be hooked up before you buy it.  I know that you can purchase an additional transformer and bypass the doorbell; call me old school, but i still want the doorbell to ring when someone comes to the door.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but they're not kidding REQUIRES 16v transformer,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2017","<span>
  Installed easily, but kept falling off the network.  Last voltage check would say Very Good, but then it would go offline .. Transformer upgrade isn't a big deal other than 2 factors.  First you have to locate the transformer your existing doorbell is on.  Mine was pretty easy because I have an unfinished basement and it was installed next to the furnace, but many times it's installed behind finished walls or ceilings where you don't have a visual or easy access (view how to upgrade a transformer online).  Second is whether or not the transformer is also performing for anything other than the doorbell.  Mine was also hooked to the furnace.  Still not a big deal as long as additional connections work fine with a 16v.  Replacing the old transformer with the new involved just a few wires and took 5 min.  Ring does sell a cable that you install on the existing chime to boost the wattage, but then the existing doorbell no longer chimes.  You can buy a Ring Chime that plugs in and that's their solution presently.<br><br>I had to buy a 3rd party adapter to install mine at a 40 degree angle.  It works as advertised but feels and looks cheap even though I bought the best one I could find.  Wish Ring would sell an angle install kit that had the same quality as the doorbell on their site .. one stop shopping!  My other wish is that a doorbell ring would actually ring my iPhone instead of just sending an alert and even send the Ring sound to my Echo Alexa enabled devices. Lastly, I'm guessing one of their techs will be working on an upgrade to the existing power adapter (installed on existing doorbell) that will also allow you to boost the voltage without loosing the existing door chime's ring

  I haven't caught anything nefarious or anything on my ring but I definitely have alot more peace of mind knowing its there. Since I've installed it I've got to interact with every visitor to my house, who knew I even had that many! Just today a young man came to to my door to sell t shirts that he had made to help him pay for college. Without the ring I would not be able to help this young man. But since I had the ring I was able to look at his shirts, which were a very cool design, and tell him to come back later and I would gladly buy one. And he did, and now I'm a proud owner of a custom made t-shirt. The motion sensor is also sensitive enough to catch birds if you set it high enough. I've figured out I  have a red breasted robin that visits my front door daily as well as a beautiful blue jay that lives in an adjacent tree. So I bought it for security but I've been  impressed by alot of other things with it. Pretty awesome if you ask me. I will be buying more of their products.

  Ever since we got our candy cane Christmas decorations stolen a few years back I've wanted to get a camera by our front door. With so many options for cameras, I thought the best move was to get a video doorbell. I ended up purchasing the Ring Video Doorbell Pro. One of the main factors in choosing this option was that it used the wiring from my existing doorbell so I didn't need to worry about power and it connected to my home network without needing to be plugged into another box. The ability for it to connect with SmartThings was also a big factor. I was also able to get it on sale, saving myself about $50.<br><br>Installation<br><br>The installation was very easy. They provided the tools and clear instructions on what to do. The first step was to install the power kit to your doorbell box. It is only a couple of wires and then you are done.<br><br>The next step was to remove your existing doorbell and hook up the Ring. The kit even came with a drill bit and anchors if you need to go through cement or plaster. My home has siding and wood so all I needed to do was put in the screws to mount it. Again, very easy.<br><br>My main concern is with the placement of my Ring because of where my previous doorbell was placed. It is about 12"" from my door so the angle isn't what I had hoped for. The other problem was my siding, it is sloped so the bottom of the sided comes out more than the top which makes the Ring camera point upward. When looking through the camera I could see the side of someone's head while they stood at my door.<br><br>I decided to hack it a little bit by attaching some material on the back of the ring. I placed it on the top and on one side of the unit to angle the camera down and tilt it more towards the door. This helped but didn't completely fix the issue. Doing this made a big gap on the top and right side of the unit which I filled in with clear caulk. Luckily, it still looks okay. If you have this issue, Ring actually sells wedge kits that will angle the device downward or tilt it to one side. That would be another $19 so the DIY hack is good enough for me.<br><br>Mobile App<br><br>The next step in the process was connecting it to my network and setting up the app. This was also an easy process. It took you through the standard process of changing your wifi to the signal that the device sends out and then going back to the app to select your network and authenticating it to establish the connection. The rest of the process was giving the device a name and location and choosing what type of doorbell you have, mechanical, digital or none.<br><br>The location uses your home address and is used for their My Neighborhood service which is still in beta. This feature has some cool potential and hopefully it turns out good. It allows you to connect to a neighborhood and if others are using a Ring device you can share videos or alert others of any suspicious activity.<br><br>Overall. the app could use some improvements. The biggest announce was the constant banner telling me I need to sign up for the free month of video hosting. I couldn't get the banner to leave until I signed up, which I did. I am not a 100% convinced that I want to use their hosting. It stores up to 6 months of the video for you but for a DIYer like myself, I'd rather send those videos to another hosting service that I control. I realize it is their money maker but it also might be their downfall. It is $3.00 a month so it won't break the bank but it still is another hosting service I am paying for.<br><br>I really like the notifications from the device and how it allows me to quickly open up the live view. The rest of the app is functional. You can easily turn off the ring alerts and motion alerts. There are some prominent buttons on there that I won't be using and I wish they were out of the way, like the device health, partners, and linked chimes. Even the shared users don't need to always be there. These are things that you might want to set up once or see every-so-often but they need to be out of the way.<br><br>Motion zones<br><br>I love the idea behind the motion zones. I don't want to be notified every time the camera picks something up. My camera picks up houses across the street and a heavy used sidewalk in front of my house. Being able to set the motion zones enables me to be alerted only when someone has come to my door.<br><br>Unfortunately, the simple task of setting up the zones isn't as simple as you'd think. Because the zones I wanted to set up are at the bottom part of the camera I have to fight with the action bar that is there. You can tap the screen to hide the bar but when you go move one of the anchors the bar would reappear, making it hard to get the anchor to the position you want. Its actions are still doable but it gets a little frustrating having to keep tapping the screen for the bar to go away only to have it come back. This could be a quick win for the Ring product team to fix this issue. I have seen others complain about this issue and I'm convinced that if the Ring team watched their users go through this process, they would fix it. Hopefully in the next app update.<br><br>SmartThings integration<br><br>I am a big advocate for the SmartThings system and anything I buy for home automation needs to be able to connect to it or I won't even bother with it. The Ring does connect with it and allows you to use the motion sensor to trigger events but you can't utilize the camera within the SmartThings app. Not a big deal right now but would be nice to see. Of course, SmartThings keeps telling us that using a camera and capturing video from their service is a premium feature but we can use it free while in beta. This might be the reason that I look into another smart home system so hopefully, they figure that out that will benefit all of us and let us use our cameras.<br><br>Overall thoughts<br><br>1. I have been satisfied so far with what the Ring is capable of and I'm happy that I have purchased it. Of course, the price point is still too high and I wouldn't buy it unless it is on sale. Don't worry, if you watch Amazon, it seems to go on sale often.<br><br>2. Because of my existing wire location, the camera is set too high and doesn't give me the best angle. Also, with the slant of my siding, the camera is slightly pointed upward. I had to do a hack to get it working okay.<br><br>3. They force you into the monthly service option. Every time I got on the app I would see the annoying message to sign up before it's too late.<br><br>4. The motion zones aren't easy to set up. Because most of the motion zones that you'll set up will probably be at the bottom of the picture, you'll be fighting with action bar at the bottom of the screen.<br><br>5. My Neighborhood feature could be a great benefit. I'm really excited to see what this feature brings. There is only one other person using this in my area, it would be great to get more people using to really benefit from it. Now that I think about it, that is a great Marketing feature since I will probably start telling my neighbors about it.

The icon I'm talking about isthe one you see in live view that is in the lower right hand corner that is to the right of the microphone on/off icon.<br>Other issue not addressed that ring was supposedly working on since last year (you can find it on their website) is giving you options on the length of time it automatically records.<br>Currently the ring pro which is hard wired to doorbell power only allows just over 1 minute (about 1 minute 4 seconds) of recording and cannot be adjusted.<br>Next issue is even at the least sensitive motion setting it still is picking up all of the traffic at night as it reacts to headlights.  My ring is at least 75 feet from the street edges where the ring can see and reacts before a vehicle is actually seen (that's how I concluded its reacting off the headlights).<br>Why still 4 stars?  It does take very nice videos and pretty much works as advertised.<br>The one issue I would like updated the most is user selectable recording time.<br>Would also like separate customizations for different selectable times or at least night and day so the units sensitivity could be adjusted instead of one setting for all days/times/conditions.

  I wish I would have bought this sooner. I have not had my ring pro long yet, but as of now, I am very satisfied and so is my family.  Did not have to buy anything extra to make it work. I have pretty good WiFi and I didn’t need a new transformer for doorbell. Everything I need was in place already. I paid for installation and he was quick and fast. 20 minutes and he was gone. My entire family can monitor who comes in and out of house. I can look outside my door without getting up and looking out of window at any time I want. My son knows when I leave the house to come and get him because he has the app on his phone. I use it on my echo show. I really don’t have any dislikes at this time, it does just what I need it to do and some.

  We were excited to add a smart doorbell to our growing smart home tech. Unfortunately, the ring doorbell is very finicky on its wifi connection. While my phone and other devices connect outside and by the door, and the ring initial setup worked, it dropped the wifi connection constantly. We even got a wifi extender &lt;10ft from the door but still had connection problems. Now with all the bad press about privacy leaks of owners' video, we have reconnected the original plain old doorbell.

  Going strong for a year now and hasn't flinched once.  However I installed a 24VAC transformer on ours as opposed to the minimum 16VAC.  They run fabulous and with a good WiFi/broadband connection the motion notification is near instantaneous.  However it seems the low IP rating of 59(??) could be a problem.  Looks like some moisture got it one of them and now, only at night, I see a translucent water ring in the lens.  Need to call them about this.

  This video doorbell is really quite good but I have two issues I would like to express with the maker: (1) why won’t you allow the video to be turned portrait instead of landscape?  Most doorbells are located inside a covered vestibule area of a house like a small porch.  Wide angle does no good here.  I want portrait setup instead of landscape.  Is that hard to change in the software, a choice?<br><br>(2) the other thing that is annoying is I have to use a tool to take the cover off to allow pairing to my network?  What the heck is that all about?  Just put the pairing button on the outside and not force us to use that little frustrating screw driver.

  This worked great for the first 2 months. My wifi signal is very strong and I had the motion detection dialed in to a perfect zone that would detect motion in only the areas I wanted. The night vision detection worked flawlessly. I was very impressed with this product.<br><br>But after 2 months of reliable operation, the motion detection started to degrade. It began to miss certain motions that were clearly detected previously. I thought it was just a random problem with the signal or something but the motion detection continued to degrade. Now today after 3 months of use, it no longer detects àny motion at night, not even my vehicle when I pull into the driveway. And it randomly misses day time motions that were never missed before. I tried resetting the detection zone and changed the detection settings multiple times to no avail. My wifi signal is strong so the problem must be with the bell itself. This is unacceptable especially for a product in this price range.<br><br>I was thinking about expanding my home security with other Ring products, but if this unreliability is indicative of the quality of Ring products, I will look elsewhere for my home security needs.<br><br>I've given up trying to fix this and now I'm just stuck with an expensive doorbell.

  Even though I had the company's contractor install it, the doorbell, which is in a strong wi-fi signal area, disconnects after a day or two of being restored to the Internet.  As a result, it has only an intermittent relationship with Alexa and iPhone and the video storage service I also bought.  But most of the time won't even ring the doorbell -- despite the fact that I bought one of the company's dedicated chimes after discovering that it was essentially useless with my legacy door chime. On those rare occasions when it works, it's nice.  But it's mostly very disappointing.

Also nice to be able to communicate with people at your door.  the only thing I miss with this product, is that at night, without an additional light source, it won’t pickup motion from more than a few inches from the doorbell.  It does pickup bugs crawling within a few inches of the doorbell, but nothing else, unless I leave my exterior lights on all night (which I don’t).

  The doorbell itself is handy.  Being notified that someone is at my door when I'm away from home is pretty cool but I live on a major street and the speaker volume on the unit is so low that the person at my door cannot hear me speak over the street traffic.  I chatted with Ring and they attempted to remotely increase the volume on the unit, only to find out it's already at Max.  So if you live in a nice, quiet neighborhood, this would work well.  But if you have any street noise, you won't be able to communicate with whoever is at your door.  And since that's one of their selling points, it falls short of delivering on its promises.  In my case, it's a $250 doorbell with little other functionality.  To be clear, the app can control the chime volume inside the house.  That's great.  But there was no thought put into making it usable for people who live in a .populated area with street noise.

  This product really works overall well.  It was very easy to set up with the directions provided, easily connected to wifi, and was up and working with an overall setup time of maybe 20-30 minutes.  The only complaint I have is that at times it's slow to connect when someone rings the doorbell when I'm away from home, but it depends where I am and the connection there I think.  It is still always recording even if you can't connect to see the video right away.  The picture quality is really beautiful and clear.

  I live at the end of a street and I get a lot of false hits due to the headlights of vehicles coming down the street directly towards my house.  every time the headlights sweep the doorbell it triggers.  During the day it works ok letting me know people are coming up my driveway,  but if I tried answering the doorbell via the app the person would give up and leave before I got to answer.  overall, it works for what I particularly wanted so I am keeping it, but consider how you would use it.  Being at the gym or coffee-shop and responding to someone via the app at your door is really not probable.  The time delay is just too long for it to reasonably seem like you might be inside the door.

  I use this every day.  I can talk to people at my door wherever I am.  The design is sleek and installation was easy.  The sound quality is very clear when using the devices speaker.  The 1080p quality is great and the motion detection is excellent.  It will detect if you turn on/off lights by the door in the motion zones (you create where it will detect motion in its view) and sometimes when the sun comes up.  It's about the only flaw I would say it has, but I don't really mind because I know it's doing its job.  It does have a slight delay when chiming my home's built-in bell, but the chime on the Ring Doorbell itself is instant and the message sent to my smartphone is also instant.  It's not a big deal for me like some reviewers have mentioned.  The noise the device makes when the button is pressed can be heard from within the house anyway.  You get a free 30-day trial of the premium subscription included when you set up your device.  And if you choose to upgrade to the monthly or yearly service (I did the yearly since it's only $30/yr) it won't stop your trial and your subscription will start after the 30 days, so you still get the first month for free.  I highly recommend this doorbell!

  It didn't take long to get this camera mounted. Connecting it to Wi-Fi was also fairly simple (the floodlight cams were a little more quirky in terms of connection process). The image and audio are both pretty good. It's easy to set up the motion zones and the sensitivity. Whether the camera actually follows the zones and sensitivity you set up is another thing. I think for the price and simplicity of setup this is a pretty good system. I don't like the sometimes glitchy mobile device experience and I think the sensitivity zones and settings are not all that great. Night vision is decent, but know that it will be a smaller area than what you can view in the day.

This led to burning out my chime transformer and door bell led. Ring should have made this potential issue more prominent on their website and install instructions. I feel that Ring is trying to make install seem easy and they don’t provide enough necessary information. Also, Ring guidelines say you need a transformer rated at 16-24 volts and that a 16 volt, 10 volt amp transformer will work.

It really isn't very well thought out in regards to buffering, if it would work more like a car dash cam with local storage, at say the transformer I would have been very happy.<br><br>As it is I choose not pay for the storage plan, I found that there is no free 7 day cloud storage, and that if you don't pick up the notification as it happens, either motion or doorbell activated, you will not be able to see the recording at all, not that it ever really picks up for me. I waited too long to try and return the Ring Pro, and am now stuck with an almost useless lump. It is great for the notifications of movement, but I'm sure I could have wired up something better for far less. I will revise my score if I ever find a way to hack this thing, or get better upload speeds. The next product I've seen in the pipeline looks even more expensive and looks to have almost all the same limitations.

  If you expect this to work like the commercials, don’t!  We have 1gig internet fiber to the home and we can’t answer the door from the app before the person walks away, when they ring the bell.  We had to break down an upgrade to have ring record the video to their servers so we could at least see who we missed.  Now we can call if from the app anytime and it works flawless!  They really need to work on this, it’s far from complete and if I could do it all over again, I wouldn’t buy it at all.  I was in an ignorant bliss not knowing someone rang my bell, now I am constantly frustrated I cant answer the rind from the APP.  I thought it would get better once Amazon bought ring out, but I was wrong!  Please, please don’t bother spending money on this.

  I have had this for long enough ""mid July"" to mid August"" give it what I would say is a fair review. I bought this seeing it was compatible with Android and Windows 10 O.S. . Being a stranger to the layout look of Windows 10 WIFI connections interface that I found it far easier to set it up through my Android device first. Android made it beyond simple to connect to my existing home WIFI network. I did find out the hard way to "" NOT "" reset my WIFI router after Ring setup has been completed. However Ring customer support was way beyond being not only helpful but patient with me after my HUGE mistake of re-setting my WIFI Router. I have had NO problems every since and I have added the Stick up Cam and the WIFI Range Extender to my Home Security WIFI network. I would and do recommend this to friends. UPDATE: As of 04/13/2018 I continue to use RING with NO product failures.The one product I miss ( The Stick Up Cam) is rather disappointing since I was adding to my system as I could afford to do so.only to find out their most affordable cam has been discontinued. I guess my video security has grown as large as it is going to unless ( The Stick Up Cam) is brought back.

When the video did appear the audio was so bad that I couldn't understand anything and the video had blockiness , but not because of a low bit rate, it looked more like video corruptions.<br><br>I hurried to the store and bought a Nest hello and installed it on the same day.

  The doorbell is a great addition to home security. The set up is very easy, BUT there are issues that need to be addressed with each individual install.  First: know your doorbell transformer. You must have at least 16v for the device to work properly. Second: know your internet connection speed and have the router close to where the doorbell will be installed.  The first device I bought was totally defective. I spent hours on the phone with customer support before they decided there was something wrong with the device and sent me a new one. Once I installed the new device, it has been working fine!! On occasion, it will lose connection from the wifi. A simple disconnection of power and reconnection to the device will reset it. If I hadn't had all the issues initially with the first defective device, I would have rated 5 stars. Customer support deserves 5 stars, as they were very helpful and once it was determined that my device was inoperable, they overnighted me a brand new one.<br>Some small issues that I think need improvement: On the ring.com website, it will not allow you to delete any of the videos it has recorded unless you sign up for the $3/month service - even though you get 30 days free trial. You can't actually delete in bulk from the site, rather one by one on your phone or ipad - tedious waste of time.  On the Ring Video doorbell Pro you can select areas of motion, but you have NO control over the sensitivity like on the battery operated, less expensive version. That makes no sense at all. Hence, if your house faces a street, you get lots of motion alerts for cars driving by. I do not understand why on the device that operates by internal battery there is more control of the motion parameters, and on this one not.<br>Overall, I like the device and am happy with the purchase and absolutely recommend it.

  Technical support was very nice and they are sending new products.  This item worked off an on for about four hours and burned up my doorbell in a house that is 9 years old.  The mechanical doorbell was fried after using the power pack that is recommended to be used with the unit.  Again, Ring is sending a new power pack and a new doorbell chime but I purchased a new mechanical doorbell today, did not use the power pack with the unit, and the doorbell and the Ring product work just fine.  Moral of the story is that the power pack for extra power may not be needed with all doorbell products and may even be harmful.  Now that it is working and I'm over being upset, I do like the product.

  The packaging for the product is exceptional. Everything that you need to install it is included in the box, including multiple colored covers to match your house exterior. There's a video showing how to install and the steps of hooking it up to your WiFi network couldn't be easier. I did have to upgrade my 20+ year old doorbell transformer to be 16V but that was only $20 at a big box store. The Ring doorbell works great -- notifications of doorbell presses as well as any motion detected.

  Very disappointed with what I thought was going to be a great addition to our set of security cameras that we’ve had for several years. The product looked well made, was well packaged and the instructions were thorough and easy to follow, both in print and using the app. It simply would not power up. I double checked the wiring of the power kit and reconnected the original ringer which worked normally even with the new power kit still connected to the doorbell inside. I also went through the set up button and reset routine. The Ringer Pro was either defective or it was not receiving enough voltage to operate it. We have a 9 year old house, the transformer in the doorbell is listed at 16-24 volts. Our Wi-Fi router is about 12 feet from the front door. If a power booster has to be included then it should produce sufficient voltage. No one should have to purchase ancillary equipment to make it work. I’ve just returned it for a refund.

  I've been using the Ring for several month now. I like the idea of it but unfortunately its only the idea, implementation it is not so good. Today as example, and this happen a lot, I heard sound outside my door, opened the app to see what is going on, only took several minutes for the app to connect to service and actually couldn't see anything and decided to kill it. I have excellent net and router by the door. You also need to pay monthly for videos to be stored. I understand storage cost money (really cheapest part in cloud services these days is storage) Oh well! I like the neighborhood sharing feature, brilliant idea. Over all this service is promising but in retrospect, I'll go for more basic solution that doesn't require connecting to service over internet, something instant and perhaps something that stores videos locally as the video playback in the Ring app is extremely slow and almost useless.

  I really like my Ring doorbell Pro.  I installed it myself and it works perfectly.  Good visibility left to right and it's very clear.  Sound quality is acceptable too to and from.  The night time viewing is actually clearer and brighter than Ring's stick up camera, however the stick up camera is pretty good too.  This is based on using the mobile app on my iPhone 7.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.  It's not cheap, but it works!  **One suggestion to Ring on the next model up, make the mounting holes on the doorbell available on the far left or far right sides instead of only being in the middle of the doorbell.  Some homes need this flexibility with the wood trim around the original doorbell being too narrow to mount the Ring-IE: carpenter might be needed.*

With an internet connection with a strong signal connection was time consuming and problematic but once successfully connected no issues.

  The app is often slow, especially when trying to look at something in a hurry.  It's as if the app knows you want it to load quickly and purposely slows down and/or refuses to connect to Ring.com at all.  The same happens on our Echo Show, sometimes it fails to connect and show the live feed when requested.  Reviewing videos via the app is often cumbersome.  The app does not allow you to quickly jump ahead or back in videos - you tap the timeline along the bottom of the screen to jump ahead ~20 seconds and it takes nearly that amount of time to load and start playing that part of the video.  The camera struggles with quick changes in lighting.  If lightning strikes during a storm the motion alert is triggered.  If porch lights are on and turned off the motion already are triggered.  If a car drives up the street (where we have no motion zone) at just the right angle so its headlights hit the camera the motion alert is triggered.  Outside of the app, the doorbell itself is easy to install and looks sleek.

  We live in a condominium. Our intercom system was upgraded about a decade ago and at that time our original 1970s doorbell stopped working. I guess it was getting power from the old intercom system. A recent event sparked the need for a doorbell and thanks to the constant advertisements on the Howard Stern Show, I decided to go with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro.<br><br>Installation was a challenge since I had no power running to my existing, broken doorbell. I have never cut holes or dry walled in my life, so a standard doorbell transformer was not an option. After some light skimming through other Amazon reviews, I decided to go with the ELK TRG1640 Transformer since i had a power outlet conveniently located on the other side of the doorbell. After drilling some small holes and using the Gardner Bender EFT-21PN 25-foot Cable Snake, I was able to cleanly wire up and mount my Ring. No additional accessories, resistors, diodes, power units were necessary.

  As we all know Amazon Prime shipping is outstanding. Now on to the meat and potatoes of the Ring thus far. Installation was quick and painless as described.  Once it went through the initial processing, it powered on with no issues. However, it did take a few extra minutes to connect with my WiFi and to be honest, that’s understandable since it is trying to pull data from inside the house. So far, Ring is performing as advertised and I am impressed. I will tell you, you might need to adjust the motion setting, because I have received multiple motion alerts due to cars passing by (see second picture). That is not a knock on the system, but I don’t need to be notified every time a vehicle drives by my house. I was a bit worried about the location of the previous doorbell, as I thought the pillar would be in the way. As you can see from the picture, it not an issue. I’ve read plenty of negative reviews about Ring and I am not knocking anyone, but I guess I’ve lucky so far. I did a test to see if it would notify me when I walked up the front and it did just that. I will do a follow up in a few weeks, but as of now, I have to give it 5 stars. If you are boarding on the fence, I say, buy it. Everyone’s experience will be different.  Good luck.

  Nice slim design that fit perfectly where our old doorbell was. I did need to get a new transformer since the old one didn’t have quite enough power to keep things up and connected. When someone rings the doorbell there is a lag between when they push the button and when you can respond. It’s not as instantaneous as the commercial would have you believe. That said, it works great. I know when someone is at the door even if I’m in the garage.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Huge Improvement over Ring Video!,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2017","<span>
  So far the Ring Video Pro is living up to the great reviews. We purchased this to replace the Ring Video Doorbell and the difference is amazing. The Ring Video Doorbell was just a waste. It simply would not detect any motion and when it did, you would get a view of the backside of the delivery person. Customer service kept saying the Internet speed was insufficient yet the speed tests always were good. We installed the Ring Pro 11 days ago and it's a totally different experience. Motion detection is amazing. It even begins capturing the recording 1 or 2 seconds before the image appears (probably from memory or something) which is really great because you have a recording of the person the second they come into your motion range. But I'm not picking up cars driving by or wind blowing the branches. Installation was a bit more involved as you have to install the power booster into your existing Doorbell chime box. It also took awhile for the additional power to properly cycle to the Ring Pro (maybe an hour). But connecting to the Internet was a breeze. No shortage of Internet speed with this one. The video quality is pretty good. Not great (thus the 4 stars) but you could identify the person and if necessary, save and enhance the video. Overall, this is a pretty good product and I would recommend it. One negative - I paid $249 for the Pro. Today, 11 days later it's down to $215! There should be some kind of 30 day price guarantee.

  When we first set it up, it went off everytime there was any movement. We adjusted the sensitivity and had to lower it to the lowest setting just to make it not go crazy everytime a car passed by. On this lowest setting it now doesnt go off everytime someone comes over or leaves our house. It's like the settings are either to let it go crazy when a car goes by so that it will work when someone is on my porch or it wont work all the time. I really didnt get it so I would be notified when someone drove down my street. I wanted to be notified if someone were in my yard or on my porch and its looking like that isnt an option here.

  After reading many reviews, it seemed that the major issues are low voltage and slow Wifi speed. Before I ordered the Ring Doorbell Pro, I had checked the voltage at the doorbell and the WiFi speed at the front door. The voltage from the existing (40 year old transformer) was under 12 volts! The wifi speed was excellent at 65 mBps at the front door. I ordered the recommended (by Ring) Elk plug in transformer.<br>Now, With plenty of power (24 vac) and good wifi speed, I ordered the Ring Pro.<br>Installation was simple and everything worked perfectly. The Ring Pro connected to the wifi in under 20 seconds.<br>I did have a question about the Pro Power Cable (not the included Pro Power Kit.)<br>A call to Ring customer service got a very excellent rep on the phone, the cable was ordered (free) and she checked my Ring Pro and determined that it needed a firmware update which she completed while we were talking on the phone.<br>It has performed flawlessly. The motion zones are set to exclude the street and sidewalk. I've also got the zone about a foot off the porch floor to stop chipmunk and squirrel alerts. Sensitivity is set at lowest (think it's called ""People only"").<br>Working absolutely without issues.<br>My feeling is that most problems that other reviewers are having are low power or slow internet speed issues.<br>I'd absolutely buy this again.<br>Two things that I'd like to see. Apple HomeKit integration (promised this year) and auto open live view when motion is detected. An Apple TV app would be nice.

  Super easy install, I love that they include wedges to correct any camera angles that might be catching too much wall.  I wasn't expecting it to be as big as it was, but this ended up being the perfect size to fit the vinyl backplate where my old doorbell was. The combination of a Show and the Ring Doorbell is nice.  When someone comes to the door it will automatically send the video feed to the show and Alexa will announce ""Someone is at the door.""  Also, the App is very nice.  I love scrolling back through my feed and watching the time-lapse effect.  Watching the rain come in and the concrete go from soaking wet to dry as a bone within seconds.

  Frustrating. So frustrating. If it were a cheap camera, then sure, whatever. But it's expensive and the company pretends to be so great but they can't get the app and servers to work right, of all things.<br><br>1) The live view almost never loads when you click the pop-up on your phone when someone rings or approaches. Even when connected over wifi. Just spins on the loading screen and then says it can't connect right now. No, it will let you actually view the love feed several minutes later when the person is gone. When it does load, I don't like the delay.  I have Reolink cameras, with SD cards inside rather than cloud service, but their interface works amazing and fast in comparison. Come on, Ring/Amazon.<br><br>2) For a while it recorded darkness. Nothing. Called service. Turns out an issue on their end that they know about and hired a new tech team or something. Needed to reset the device.<br><br>3) Notifications of any kind stopped despite reinstalling the app, on both my and my wife's phones. Turns out we need to clear cache and reinstall sometimes.<br><br>4) Rarely works over cellular service. Doesn't load the camera. Need to be on wifi. I'm on Sprint. Not an issue for my wife who is on Verizon. Turns out it's a problem known for many years, if you Google it. Doesn't work over this or that IPv6 protocol or something like that.<br><br>(Edit note: I keep remembering more issues, so updating)<br><br>5) Infrequently find evidence that it missed a motion and didn't record it. Had a box delivered, and recorded on camera. Came home..no box. No recording of the box moving or being moved. My wife and I thought we went insane.<br><br>6) Microphone is not good. It picks up my wife's voice great. No issue. But it can never pick up my voice, our mail lady, or certain other males. Don't get it. For my voice, it's super broken up. Cannot understand. Ugh.<br><br>7) (update) Now it is missing a large chunk of every event. For example, it'll record the mail person walking up...then leaving. Nothing in between. Or it'll record the approach and then stop.<br><br>Camera should be under $100 and service free or almost free to be worth it.  I am going to buy a PoE camera and install it near the door and cancel this service.

  I bought the Ring Pro after a lot of research because of all the great reviews.  The experience didn't live up to the expectations.  My first device arrived DOA.  It wouldn't power up at all, but didn't get declared DOA until after I was asked to replace my transformer twice.  The second device had a hard time connecting to my home WiFi during setup.  Once connected it would randomly drop from my network, or randomly power completely off.  Ring support tried to sell me a $50 WiFi extender but I refused to buy it - my WiFi signal at the doorbell is more than adequate.  I agreed to have another replacement unit shipped overnight to me, but for some reason Ring shipped it ground and it was scheduled to be delivered when I would be out of town.  I refused delivery, and then arranged to return the doorbell for a full refund.<br><br>I've since installed a Nest Hello and it has worked flawlessly, has a better picture, and a simpler app interface.<br><br>My impression of the Ring Pro is that it's a great idea poorly executed.

  I was pretty frustrated with this ring at first.<br>The ring is talked super easy. Just had to connect the ends of the existing doorbell to the ring, and add a power booster to the doorbell itself. Took less than 30 mins<br>My frustration was really on me. I had poor WiFi signal even though the router was 10’-0” away. And had poor power readings, with the ring going in and and out of service.<br>What I should have done is researched this a little more. The ring recommends a 16v, 30a transformer. Most homes come with a 16v, 10a. After a few days of frustration I read ALL of the instructions. And found the transformer recommendation. Once I got the transformer I needed everything worked fine. Just took a couple of more days for amazon to deliver the transformer, because no one in town carried a 16v, 30a transformer.<br>I still had problems connecting the ring to my WiFi, but once I changed some settings on my router, and connected to the router to a 2.4Ghz connection instead of a 5Ghz connection it was fine.<br>My biggest frustration now is the constant paranoid neighbors that post stuff everyday But this isn’t a problem with the product. ;)<br>So, great product, make sure you know what you have in your house already, and what you will need in order to have this running smoothly on the day you install it.

  Pros<br>• The camera on the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is superb. The image is crisp and clear especially during the day.<br>• The range of motion detection is excellent, detecting motion of large objects (like cars) approximately 250 feet away.<br>• The Doorbell is fairly easy and quick to install. The doorbell kit includes extra face plates in a variety of finishes, 3 mounting plates to adjust the angle of the Doorbell and the hardware and tools (drill bit &amp; screwdriver) needed for installation.<br>• Works well with Alexa devices but you have to ask Alexa to show the live video. It would be nice if the Ring alerts could activate the video feed to Alexa.<br><br>Cons<br>• To save and view video the Doorbell records, you need to purchase a Ring Protect Plan. There is free trial for 30 days then a $3 monthly charge for the Protection Plan. Without the Basic Plan the Doorbell is virtually useless. If I am away from home and cannot access the Ring app the instant I get a motion or chime alert, I cannot check to see what caused the motion or who rang the bell. If you can check the app right away, but are in area with poor WIFI connection, by the time the you are connected to the Doorbell’s video, whatever activated it will probably be gone.<br>• My Doorbell is mounted to a brick wall so while the Doorbell is flush against the bricks, there are gaps between the sides of the Doorbell mounting plate and the mortar. Not a great look.<br>• The Doorbell came with anchors to mount to a masonry surface, but the Doorbell could easily be pulled off the wall with little effort.<br>• There is a small screw that goes on the bottom of the Doorbell  to secure the face plate. The face plate simply &amp; easily snaps on and off the Doorbell. There is a button on the side of the Doorbell beneath the face plate that you need to push to Set Up the Doorbell. You also need to push this button to reset the Doorbell. I had to repeat the Set Up steps and access this button several times in the first few weeks of installing the Doorbell. I don’t recommend using the tiny screw because it has to be removed every time you need to take off the face to press the Set Up button.<br>• During the first two weeks the Ring Doorbell worked fine with the existing internal doorbell chime. It no longer works even though the Device Health monitor on the Ring apo show the voltage to the Doorbell is “Very Good.”

  I honestly thought I could wire this up myself. I am good with electrical connections, and have done plenty of work on my home. I needed to find the transformer in the attic and switch it out with a higher voltage 18v with enough power to drive the HD camera. I bought the transformer, and a new doorbell itself from Amazon. My son and I just couldn't find the transformer in the attic. I ended up paying an electrician to install it. He couldn't find it either, so we decided to just cut the old one, cut the existing doorbell, and do a fresh install. I ended up not needing the transformer, or the new doorbell. We are pleased with it overall. I am just saying that you may find additional costs in its installation. In my case it was under $700, so it's not just the cost of the Ring itself. BTW, we are using the Ring doorbell which plugs into a wall outlet. It has a pleasant ring sound, which my wife likes, compared to the old ""Ding Dong"" we had.

Amazon does not explain that you have to pay for a cloud subscription to store and retrieve the short videos of ring and motion events- very crappy! The promotional material and install instructions are structured such that you do not catch this until the unit is installed and you use it for a day or two.  I am giving this just one star because they are not up front about the need for a paid subscription and the lack of a local event video storage option. You pay so much for this item and they want for you to continue to pay now for the use of these fetures. I hear Nest is a better option, so do your homework.

   We initially started with Arlo cameras and found them to have a poor motion response.  We would often get them on tape just as they were turning to walk away.  With the Ring that is not the case.  The installation was very easy with great online tutorials, the app is very intuitive and easy to use.  The motion zone setup feature is easy to use and make modifications with.  There are no issues with the camera missing the subject as they approach and the audio is great.  I would buy Ring again.  ONE ISSUE.  See picture.  If you have a set back doorbell like mine, the infrared lighting reflects off of my brick causing the picture to be overexposed.  I taped a piece of cardboard colored with a flat black sharpie and that cut the glare down significantly.

It has a snooze feature on it if you don't want to get notified every 3 minutes in the morning when everyone is headed out, there's the ""Neighbors"" section where you can see other Ring users close to you sharing videos of suspicious activity. Other than having to upgrade my doorbell transformer to a newer 24 volt one ($12 at the Home Depot)for consistent power it's pretty much paid for itself. I will update this review once I spend more time with it.

  very unstable product when it comes to power. connected to existing doorbell wires, at night stopped working saying insufficient power (i guess because of the infrared light). shows 3.5V power, while i am measuring with a voltmeter 20V. Technical support is useless, had to ""ask someone"" the whole time and at the end gave me scripted answers that i could find in the online documentation myself. my suggestion is to buy the battery operated model, and just deal with charging the batteries every once in a while. or use this model with a 3rd party power transformer, which defeats the whole purpose of using the existing doorbell wires

  At first it worked great the moment there was motion Alexa would announce someone was at the front door. But it chimes outside when it detects motion. I don't know why I guess to alert would-be thieves. But since it chimes no one knows that they should still push the button to ring inside so they just stand there and I don't know there at the front door. Design flaw or our culture not fully tech savvy? Either way there should be an option to turn the outside chime off. But when someone does push the button it works exactly as I expect.

  I’ve had the Ring Pro for a little over a week now. It was very easy to install and get working.  Instructing are clear. The app works very well and the settings to customize things make a lot of sense.  It’s obvious that the developers have refined this product to make it a lot better than it was in the past.  It shows.  I get a strong network connection, crystal clear video, and just the right amount of notifications (although I will probably lower the sensitivity as it does pick up a lot of cars driving by).  The night views are very clear as well.  I knew going into this that I would have to pay a small amount to store my videos online. No big deal though.  I did have to turn set the motion schedule though because I got tired of getting notifications at night when cars drove by.  It’s good they have this setting.<br><br>I don’t write a lot of reviews but felt I needed to counter some of the negative ones that have been posted about this product as I had a totally positive experience.  Remember, satisfied customers don’t write nearly as many reviews as unhappy customers.  So this one is worth 5-10 negative reviews in my opinion.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family.

  I LOVE having a Ring doorbell. I got one for the front door and one for the side door. I'll be at work and get an alert that there's motion or someone is at my door and I'll just pop into the app on my phone and see what it is. It gives you great peace of mind. When I see that I've gotten a delivery, if someone is home I just text them and ask them to get my package and bring it inside. Never give the porch pirates a chance, am I right? I put the Echo Show in my bedroom (camera lens covered at all times unless I need it) Alexa is my alarm, she performs my ""Good Morning"" routine, I have her turn on and off my lights (smart bulbs required), add things to my shopping list, I mean...Alexa is an amazing tool and I can use it together with two Rings (doorbells) to rule them all.

  How did we live without this? Video quality is amazing. The field of view is good, but I still ended up installing a corner angle kit to be able to see if someone was close to the door. Answer the door from anywhere. See when the delivery person leaves a package. With the motion feature, you know before somebody rings or knocks. On high sensitivity, it would capture cars driving by the house. On low sensitivity, it catches all people and occasionally the tree swaying in very high wind. The monthly subscription for cloud storage is a bummer, but it works great, so 3/mo is a small price to pay for piece of mind. I also upgraded the doorbell transformer, but that might have been overkill. We have a wireless AC router and 100 Mb internet service, and latency with the Ring Pro has not been an issue. Update: lasted 2 years, 4 months. Apparently that is pretty good, from what I could tell in forums. The unit has an internal lipo battery that goes bad and is not replaceable (without some hacking/soldering). For the money, I expected better. While it works, it’s great.

  So I have had this for a couple years now. It’s greatest downfall is speed. It is very slow. It  has a delay in everything it does. I get a lot of pickups from the mailman. It almost always starts recording when he is almost back to his truck. I have a medium length driveway. Camera is slow to activate when using the app to just check on things. Most of the time people cant understand me. Video is often choppy or pixelated. It it’s about 10ft from my router. I have had two routers and both connect to devices just fine. My internet speed is on average 80 Mbps. I have changed the zones around and nothing has improved. Save your money, try another companies device.

  So far so good. This is my first Ring product. I was very impressed with this door bell. Install was simple enough. Only two issues. The holes on the  larger plate that sits against the wall did not match up with the holes on the angled mount. I had to mark the spots and remove the wall plate to drill secondary holes for the angled mount. Not a huge deal but it did take a few extra minutes. The second issue was connecting to WiFi. During set up it failed to connect to WiFi 5 times before finally connecting. Once connected we have had no issues and it currently shows to be getting 30mbps down with 5mbps up through the speed test on the app. Specs show only 1-2mbps both ways is needed. Overall we are very happy with it and plan on adding Ring security cameras as well.

  This thing is great and it was easy to set up. I’m far from a handy man but this was very simple. My doorbell generator met the requirements so that made things easy. There is a setting to only detect human movement which is great - this eliminates a moving tree branch setting it off which happens on my blink cameras. The motion detection is great it must detect/hear foot steps because it starts Recording before someone comes into view from the side of my house. It integrated with the doorbell chime built into my house, but the app also has custom door chimes ranging from regular doorbell noises and one for each holiday that will play on your phone.

  This was my first device of this kind and I am very happy with it. Full disclosure, I already had a Samsung Samrtthings Hub with a number of different 'smart devices connected; when I installed the Ring Video Doorbell Pro(which was extremely easy), I had a few issues getting the Ring to sync up with the Smartthings, but the technical support from Ring was very helpful and worked me through the problems. It took a couple of days to get it all worked out, but in the end the Ring synced with the Smartthings and now everything is working extremely well. I would definitely encourage anyone whose thinking about installing a 'smart' doorbell, to go with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro. I can say that I will definitely be purchasing more Ring cameras in the future.

The doorbell is less than 10 ft from the router on the 5ghz band. I also have  200/12 through Comcast, so bandwidth should not be an issue.  I'm hoping a new firmware will address the playback issue as this will definitely be a problem if I ever had a break in and needed to see the footage clearly.<br><br>Lastly​ device health shows ~4k mv and a ""Good"" connection via WiFi if that matters.

  Owned original Ring doorbell but could never seem to get the sensitivity correct, it caught passing traffic, so I landed up returning it and waited for the Ring Pro and I'm glad I did. The Ring Pro was easy to physically install, Ring app leads you through the configuration portion, I did have a couple hiccups getting it to join our home network but overall not a problem. Once it was on the network, I used the Ring app to fine tune the sensitivity and it dialed in perfectly. Overall I've liked the device much better than the original Ring doorbell. Important note, some people report lag time between image and doorbell ring, so far that has not been an issue but I do have a good wireless signal at the doorbells location.

  My setup is complicated because we have an electronic doorbell which rings through our telephone.  To simplify integration of the two systems, I mounted the Ring so when a guest pushed the Ring button, the Ring physically pushed the original doorbell button.  It worked OK and I mounted the new Pro the same way but we hear the Ring all over the house on all of our iOS devices anyway (by choice).  The Pro is great because the recording actually start before the button is pushed.  So we have a video of someone walking up to the door whether they push the button or not.  It is simply hooked up directly to a doorbell transformer without the wiring harness which comes with the Pro.  Tech support says the harness is only needed if connected to a standard wired doorbell.  Very satisfied.  Installation was much simpler than instructions.  Just hooked up new Ring Pro to wires used to hook up original Ring.  Old Ring was moved to a side door with a new transformer.  Would have preferred a brass faceplate but Pro comes with extra faceplates so I will paint one of the extras.

  We have had the unit for about a week.  Installation of the transformer on the bell and the doorbell itself were easy.  Just be sure to follow the instructions.  All the required tools and parts were included except a pliers to bed the wires around the screws, but everyone has those somewhere in the house.  Getting the app loaded and synced was no problem.  I set the motion sensitivity and found the doorbell picks up what I had hoped - motion approaching the door and anyone ringing the doorbell.  We have had one false alarm when we turned into the driveway and the headlights swept across the motion detector.  Two recommendations for improvements; first, create a way to do a mass delete rather than have to delete each incident individually.  Second, create a way to put the unit in 'standby'.  We were working near the front door after installation and had 26 motions detected as we came and went.  I turned off the notification, but the unit still sensed our presence.  Lots of incidents to delete individually.  We signed up for the cloud storage.  If we by another related device, it would be nice to get a discount on the monitoring charge for more than one unit.  Overall, very satisfied with the purchase and performance.<br><br>1/19/17 Update.  My bad.  There is a way to mass delete.  Instead of dragging left, drag right and the trash can shows up at the bottom along with the ability to mark any of the detections at one time.  Other than that, this doorbell is working well.  If I had another door that needed a doorbell, I'd buy another unit.

  This works really good. We use it mainly to keep an eye on our cats but it's good overall for whatever you need. The only thing is the motion detection. It's an all or nothing kind of thing so we constantly get alerts which at times can get annoying. We have lessened the motion but it's either people only or regular motion. We can ""silence"" it but it's still worth getting.

  Super easy to install and set up. Worked well out of the box. My only issue is with the motion sensing - the dappled shadows from a tree in my front yard often set it off, even at reduced sensitivity. And because the shadows move with the sun, there is really no way of zoning it out.

  Installation was a breeze. Note that the frame for the pro version doesn't have a built in level as I understand other/prior models may have had. As a result, I found it very useful to first attach the unit at the top screw only and then get it vertical with a small level placed tight against the side. Then mark and drill (or screw in, depending upon the material behind the unit) the bottom hole while it's dead-vertical. Super easy.<br><br>Don't be intimated by the wiring of the power kit at the bell itself. It's a 10 minute job even if double-checking everything.<br><br>Functionality is solid. Others have remarked about delays between the button press and the sounding on various iPhones and Ring Chimes. I've not had that problem. I really appreciate being notified of motion at the front porch now (so, not just when the doorbell button is pushed). No more guessing if that UPS package has arrived. The only problem is that now I can see just how hard that package is tossed onto the porch!<br><br>I wish I could change the ring-tone on the bell itself and perhaps adjust it's volume. Can't do that today but I'm willing to bet that the app software will continue to evolve for the better so I'll be patient.<br><br>Bought a second one (and a couple chimes for around the house) for our vacation home and will integrate via Ring+ with our ADT alarm system, as well.

  Ordered a Ring Video Pro doorbell. After reading numerous reviews also bought a new transformer so there would not be a voltage problem.  Since I don't have an existing doorbell also purchased a resister per Ring instructions.  After installing the Ring Pro it was from the first application of power locked up in the set up mode i.e. the ""spinning white light"" around the button.  Numerous attempts to reset failed.  Contacted Ring. They said the resister is not needed on the Pro and to replace with a fuse which I had to buy.  They implied this would solve the problem.  No reason it should. This had no effect on the operation of the Ring Pro and it continued to ""spin"".  Advised Ring by e-mail but received no response.  Returned it to Amazon for replacement.  Replacement arrived in 3 days.  Connected it to the 16V 30VA transformer power and there was no response whatsoever. No lights, no sound.  Tried a reset but unit completely dead.  Checked voltage with multimeter at the screws on the back it was 19.55VAC.  Nothing I could do but return it --- this time for a refund.  Also returned the ""Chime"" which is redundant but it did generate a WIFI signal so assume it worked.  I'll have to eat the cost of the transformer, the resister, the fuse holder, the corner mount which I had painted.  Clearly there are many that have had a good result but I'm in the other group.  I've left the wiring, etc in the wall. Maybe I'll try again in the future or buy a competing unit.

  I very much agree with the other reviews it's great as a camera, but slightly misleading with not saying upfront that you have to pay for a subscription to continue to use features it comes with.

It wouldn't connect to my Wi-Fi anymore.  I tried resetting and reinstalling, even bring it indoors to warm up, after walking through every possible reset method with Ring tech support, it was determined that a replacement was needed.  Due to the Holiday shipping rush, it took almost 2 weeks to get the replacement unit.  The installation went smoothly, and its working fine.

  Unfortunately, I didn't install this right away. It worked, for the most part, for two months, now it won't connect to wifi that is 10 feet away. The trouble shooter tells you to turn off smart connect (which wasn't on) and that's the end of the trouble shooter for stuck wifi.<br>The worst part is, for warranty replacement, you have to send the doorbell in. The well known look of that doorbell is probably the only thing preventing my packages from being stolen and now I have to do without or shell out cash for another future non functioning door bell. Thanks Amazon!

4.0 out of 5 stars,Great video doorbell,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2018","<span>
  I have had the Ring Video Doorbell Pro for a little over a week now.  I like it a lot.  Picture quality seems to be good and the intercom function works pretty good to.  Install was straight forward and only took me around 30 min or less.  I bought an add on piece from another vendor that allows the doorbell to sit at a 55 degree angle from the wall.  I think this should be something that comes in the box already as I would guess that most people's doorbells are on a wall perpendicular to the door and not next to it.<br>I give it 4 starts instead of 5 purely because to use all of the features you have to buy a monthly/yearly subscription.  It is annoying to have to pay more after you have just spend several hundred dollars on the product.  I would have liked for the cost to include the storage of the videos and all features factored in.

  I choose Ring based on the recommendation from a friend and I’m happy with it. I installed it myself and the directions were easy to follow. Now I’m seven days in so this review is coming from a newbie.<br><br>Ring provided everything I needed to install to install it (screws, wiring, faceplates in different colors, mini-screwdriver, etc).  One thing I’m grateful was included are extra wires to help extend your doorbell wiring. As I removed my old doorbell, the wire broke (to be expected with old wiring). With the wires included by Ring (and a quick view of a YouTube video), I was able to easily fix the wiring.<br><br>The video/picture quality is very good and fits my needs. My only slight complaint is that the motion detector is very sensitive (a gentle breeze sets it off) and yes I have adjusted the settings. But I can deal with that minor issue as I know it’s detecting anything that comes by my door.<br><br>Overall I’m happy with it. I’ll have to give an update a year from now but so far, everything is great!

  Nice feature set when it works but the need to take it apart and do a factory reset every couple weeks to get to to work again after locking up has really gotten old.  Really feel like we have wasted 300 bucks for a product that just does not work as advertised.  Customer service is useless.  They will not replace unit as it functions after a reset.  What good is a security cam that shuts down every couple weeks? Even the app does not warn you the camera has stopped responding, you just do not get any notices.

  I purchased the Ring Doorbell Pro in order to compliment my existing Arlo System that I had been using for a year before the Ring. I was pretty happy with the Ring Doorbell Pro as it had the best video quality out of all my home cameras.<br><br>It was also so responsive and the app itself was pretty great and cleanly designed. However, after about the 6th month period my doorbell pro just died and Ring was happy to send a new one my way. I was pretty impressed with their customer service and appreciated the fast resolution to my problem. The new unit worked well.<br><br>Then about 10 months in, the video quality just dropped drastically. Live view was even worse. Started getting artifacts, stuttering, and total black-outs. Had called support a few times these events happened and they asked me to reset the doorbell. It fixes it for a short while and then the same problem occurs over and over. I must have reset this doorbell about 20 times now.<br><br>The last straw was when we had a theft in one of our Amazon shipments that was in our front door. The doorbell pro was able to detect the movement, then record the video, but there was so much artifact that the thief's face was not clear at all. And she was in front of the doorbell at that. It also stuttered when she was walking away. We can file a police report but the video was so useless that I did not bother to do it. There was no point of sharing that video to the police when they would not even recognize the person on the video.<br><br>I am currently in the process of researching for a new doorbell camera. Ring has disappointed me for the last time and would not recommend it to anyone ever again.

  Great at recording every car that drives by at night due to headlights that are outside my motion zone however when motion occurs within the motion zone like my sidewalk, driveway or front porch it picks up movement about 75% of the time which is disappointing considering the whole point was to capture everyone that approaches my house. I have it set to the most sensitive setting and it still misses people on my actual property. But hey at least I am have recordings of all those vehicles that drive by and pose no threat whatsoever.

  I have a Nest outdoor cam and ring doorbell pro. I'm happy about the motion detection of both products. But the Ring app experience is too bad compared with the Nest app. My phone is android. Every time I clicked the notification, I cannot see the footage. I have to wait or restart the app to see the latest footage. It seems it's too slow to receive the footage data from the cloud. Also it's slow to show the history footage if I scroll back to check the history data. Compared to Ring app, the Nest app is very fast and convenient. All the test was done in the same network. I think I will buy the Nest product next time.

  Stay away!!! this product offers great promises but does not work. I work in IT and consider myself fairly tech savvy. Even after validating network speed and placing router next to Ring doorbell, response times were unacceptably slow and most times didn't even connect to allow video viewing. Also, the few videos that got saved that I was able to review later showed less that 5 or 10 frames in one minute. In plain English, this means that if someone walks into your door you may see a few pictures of that individual that could miss his/her face and make it unrecognizable (happened to me several times). I emailed back and forth with Ring for support unsuccessfully. Finally I setup an appointment support call with them but they did not call. I plan on replacing this Ring door bell with a Nest camera to enhance the other cameras I already have and know work reliably. I'll keep the Ring bell to get notified when someone touches it and use my Nest camera for video and voice communication. Hopefully, Nest will come up with a ring button to work seamlessly with their cameras and then I'll get rid of this product.

  I initially wrote a negative review regarding customer service (because I was having challenges with getting the doorbell to stop ringing after the installation).  I ended up installing the Ring Pro on my other door and it worked well. It's a great product. After I left the review, a member from the customer service department (Jason) reached out to me to understand more of my frustrations with the customer service department. He spent much time through email communication and phone communication working with me to get my questions answered and concerns addressed.  He showed interest in making sure my needs for having security at my front door were met. He demonstrated excellent customer service and service recovery.  With this experience, I am inclined to recommend using Ring products.

  I bought both the peep-hole and hardwired cameras for two separate locations. Installation and set up was a breeze, just follow the instruction folks. I can do it, anybody can do it (mechanically speaking only). The only thing, I wish it would have is a setting for pre-trigger recording for knocking/motion detect. Basically, once the knock or motion is detected, the saved video should start 2-3 seconds BEFORE the knock. Sometime I would see people walking away from the door but not as they approach the door.

  I have the two Doorbell Pros, two Spotlight Cams, and the new Home Security System with Motion Sensor and three Contact Sensors. I am running them at two different residences. At one, I replaced a Vivent system with Ring and couldn't be happier. It's easy to install, the online videos are very helpful (though I really don't like the ""vocal fry"" in the narrator's voice : ). I found it takes a while to really understand all the ins and outs of the system, but that doesn't change the fact that it's instantly usable.<br><br>One problem is that some of the instructions are not entirely complete and could be confusing. For instance, I had trouble installing the Motion Sensor. Actually mounting it was a snap, but when I went to complete installation using the Ring app, it didn't seem to be working. A quick call the Ring support informed me there is a 15-minute ""dwell time"" for the sensor to start up, a fact that is not mentioned in the instructions.  After that, no problem at all.<br><br>I've had three or four occasions to call Ring support, always for minor issues. The wait time is always short, the customer service reps always knowledgeable and polite. They can log into your devices and see for themselves what's going on. Any problems I've had have been resolved in mere minutes.<br><br>I highly recommend the Ring products.

I was hugely disappointed in this fact. I will also mention that we have a high end router a d it is less than 40 feet away from the ring pro.

  This is unreliable. My Doorbell Pro would consistently lose connection to WiFi, even with a Chime Pro. I thought it was the fault of my unreliable Internet provider , but even after changing providers (and not losing internet service in any other device) the doorbell still loses the connectivity. Resetting the Pro is not easy because the outer shell covers the reset button and that shell is held on by a tiny screw on the bottom of the shell. Amazon should think twice about their association with Ring. I’m not only out of the money for the ring devices but I paid an electrician to do the installation. Don’t repeat my mistake!

Since the original wiring at the doorbell was short, I had to use the included extender wires.  However, the extender wiring connectors were thick so I could not fit the Ring doorbell over the wiring.  (Because the hole was too small, couldn't push the wiring so the Ring doorbell was flush.)  So I had to fashion, out of scrap wood, a hollowed out plate to the exterior door jam and screw the ring to it.

  The ring is great! My biggest issue with the product is that once you install everything and restore power to it, there is no immediate indication that it is working. I work with control circuits, electronics, and troubleshooting daily and I thought the unit arrived defective.  I waited for 5min for any sign or indication that it was powered, and then diagnosed it as defective and asked for a refund.  I received a new one the next day and verified all my wiring and voltages were correct and got the same results. At this point I became very frustrated and called customer support.  Chance walked me through everything and verified my wiring, which was all correct.  He then said to give it up to 60min for it to power up or to show any sign of activity.  I took his advice and checked on it after 10min and it finally showed a white ring around the button.  Nowhere on the paper instructions does it say to wait for any amount of time to power up, and I feel that they should. On the video instructions it does say to,  “wait a couple of minutes to power up” and I did that as well thinking it was defective after 5min of waiting. Most devices, once you apply power to them, immediately give you some indication they have power. I am assuming the issue may be with the very small gauge wire my doorbell was wired with providing a lot of resistance due to the gauge and long run it spans.

  I purchased a Ring Pro Doorbell and a Ring Chime. I’m in a wheelchair so the ability to see who was at my door and answer it was desirable. I paid for Amazon professional installation. After getting the doorbell installed, it did not work. I had problems with the video not connecting, being blank, or just hanging.<br><br>I was told that my WiFi signal was weak and that a Chime Pro would fix me up. The other option to move my router couldn’t be easily done. I bought a Chime Pro. I’m out over $400 but I figured if it works…<br><br>The Chime Pro made no difference! Ring Support informed me that the problem was due to my Internet UPLOAD bandwidth. It MUST be 2 Mbit/sec minimum! Nowhere did I see such a requirement. Just upgrade my Internet speed they told me. Unfortunately, I currently have the highest speed available for my address -- 785 Kbit/sec. I checked with my ISP to make sure. You would think that the video could be buffered on my PC or IPad and then uploaded to the Net. Oh well…<br><br>After a lengthy discussion, Ring Support offered to get me a Ring Doorbell Classic. This doorbell does not have as high an upload requirement. They would exchange it for my Pro. A $70 net loss for me but if it would work… I did get them to pay for a handyman to do the push/pull. This took over 6 weeks to set up. Ring could have told me to “Take a hike” so I give them points for making the offer.<br><br>I finally got the Ring Classic installed. It still has video problems. Plenty of connection timeouts. Even thru the Chime Pro. It turns out that the Chime Pro on weaker signals may not have the 2 MB/sec bandwidth I needed! I’m going crazy at this point. I decided to get a Netgear WiFi Extender (EX6150). I plugged it in the same spot as the Chime Pro and violà, it mostly works. There are some video anomalies at the beginning but it 90% good.<br><br>I’m out over $500 but I have something I can live with. After having the Ring Classic 1 month, the battery has less than 50% charge. It must be dismounted to charge it. I have to get someone to do that for me. The Ring Pro’s battery gets recharged automatically by the existing doorbell circuitry; the Ring Classic does NOT. One reason I purchased the Pro. The Ring Classic only does 30 seconds video max. There is a Ring Doorbell 2 available that has the battery recharge feature, but it wasn’t offered. Beware of the battery drain/dismount issue if you are thinking about a Ring Doorbell Classic.<br><br>DO NOT BUY A RING DOORBELL PRO UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD INTERNET UPLOAD SPEED AND A STRONG WIFI SIGNAL.<br><br>This was an expensive lesson.

  This works only if you have smart device near you. I purchased for parents who up in age. They don't keep smart devices by them all the time. Imagine that. You actually have to connect this on the doorbell ringer inside the house. Usually a small box in a hallway. After installing the Ring door bell you hardly can hear the doorbell inside your home. This isn't what i expected for the price I paid for the Pro model. I was informed I could by a speaker that plugs into the wall in any room I wanted. For an additional $30. I had already purchased the 30deg. angle block for the front door. I'm in for $300 easily.

  For the price of the product, I felt the wiring adapters were a bit cheap. One broke as I tried to attached it to my doorbell hardware inside the home. As a result I had to twist wires together by hand making the install take about 1 hour extra. The rest of the install went well and I liked that Ring will give you some hardware to drill into masonry to install the doorbell on brick. The function of the device  looks to be excellent. There's some delay between someone touching the ""Ring"" button outside and your doorbell inside the home ringing (2 second delay). There's about a 3 or 4 second delay in the message reaching your phone which is ""ok"". I do like the fact that I can talk to people outside and the video gets recorded. The recording, audio, and video is EXCELLENT in this product. I give the install 3 stars due to a cheap parts that broke. The functionality of the system, I give 4 stars.

  Love this product! Easy to install. Cloud recording is so convenient and inexpensive; access to what's going on at your front door/porch from anywhere. My front door is inset about 3 feet from the front of my house so I wasn't sure how that would affect the wide angle. It's not ideal as one side is just a wall, but I purchased a Pro Corner Kit from Ring (basically a shim, but looks much nicer) to modify the angle a bit and it works great. I'm getting one for my mother who lives alone and getting up there in years. She could easily be overcome by someone with bad intentions by even cracking that front door. With Ring, she will be able to see and even interact with whomever is at her front door. And don't forget, it's all being recorded so there's potential recourse if something unfortunate happens.<br>Keep it in the Ring family and setup their Ring outdoor Stick Up cams for complete perimeter coverage. The only gotcha here is distance from your router or cable modem. The video becomes a bit choppy when signal strength is weak. This can be overcome with a wifi range extender but then your adding some complexity to the  installation, but still doable.

  Let me say that I really do love this products minus a few issues which took it down a star.  If you have a modern wired doorbell, you most likely will never encounter this issue.  However, I live in a 1950's house with an ancient electric doorbell.  Trying to find detailed documentation on voltage and wiring was a bear with the Pro.  There just seems to be a lack of real electrical information.  After a number of failed attempts to get this working with my existing wiring, I decided to run new wire and a new transformer.  After dealing with conflicting information about direct wiring I found online and the confusion of the use of the Pro power pack.  Me and a multimeter and about 5 different configuration tests, I got it working.  Awesome!<br><br>Then two weeks later, my Ring was taken down by a software update.  I figured out the issue; the settings reset to factory default but I had a doorstop instead of a doorbell for three days until I had the time to figure out the issue.  I assumed it was my wiring, so I spend hours trying to find fault with it rather than the Ring software.<br><br>Since then I had no other issues and its been working great.  There is sometimes a significant delay in the notifications versus other times its seems instantaneous, but that might be Internet related rather than Ring, I haven't been annoyed enough to troubleshoot it.

  I installed the Ring Pro in place of the existing door bell. It literally took 10 minutes. I eliminated all the splices and hung the booster directly off the doorbell.

This eliminated a lot of bulk and any difficulty putting the cover back on the door bell. If you don’t have the technical skill to do what I did, I highly suggest using the splices that come with the unit. The camera/button unit it's self was very easy to install, just 2 wires and a couple of screws. I had some trouble with the security screw, but once I put on my glasses, it was easy.

  I purchased a Ring doorbell Pro and two stick-up cams in late 2016. The set-up was super-easy. All three devices have Live View capability, as well as alerts, and cloud recording (free for 30 days, then $30 per year per device). it would be nice if there were discounts for multiple devices. Alerts can be muted on a scheduled basis, e.g., I mute my backyard camera all day and evening when my dogs would be in the yard, so the alerts are not going off constantly. The recordings still happen, so if there is an issue, I can review it later. The dogs' motion keeps the camera running often, so I expect the battery to run down faster. A solar panel would help there.<br>The doorbell lets you set up/draw one or more fields of view for detecting motion, so as not to detect motion outside that FOV. This works fairly well, but if lights come on or off at night and bounce off a surface in the FOV, it alerts. It also alerts if a car drives by or neighbor's lights come on outside the FOV but rain is on the walkway in the FOV, reflecting the light.<br>While Live View is available, if you answer an alert immediately, you may not see what triggered the alert, because it goes to live view until the recording file is closed in the cloud.  This may take over a minute. You can then go back and see what triggered the alert. It would be great if you could record to a home hard drive and access the file immediately from the trigger point like on a DVR.<br>Connectivity to the stick-up cams is poor since they are outside the house where the wifi doesn't reach as well. It may require a Ring Chime Pro to to improve connectivity. Ring Chime Pro (future product) has a wifi extender included.<br>Tech support has been excellent when I had questions about some features.<br>All in all, these products are excellently engineered; the app works well and easily; but you may need a few extra add-ons to make the system complete.

The tool set included in the kit showed attention to detail that I appreciated along with the two angle adapters and the retrofit bracket. Install was pretty much by the book. The Ring App is easy enough to navigate as well for day to day usage. Using Live view I was amazed by the clarity of the picture, everything was crystal clear and detailed. Then came the testing. I can certainly understand the motion alerts with me staring right at the camera a ft. away. However I don't understand the pixilated image on my phone or the garbled voice interaction between me at the doorbell and someone using their phone on the other side of the wall. I have fiber run to a home run box 10ft away and in the other direction I have the wireless router also about 10-12ft. away.  There`s only a single exterior wall between the router and Ring Pro so I have ruled out an internet connection problem. That leaves me with motion alerts. The Ring Pro can detect, however briefly, a vehicle passing by on the street and promptly sends me a motion alert. When the UPS man came yesterday it showed his truck and lagged until he dropped off the package on the porch. so the Ring Pro`s performance is sketchy right now. Maybe a firmware flash is coming along that can mitigate these issues. In summary I can see potential in the Ring Pro but where it stands right now it has a ways to go.

  Not perfect, but not horrible.  Picture quality is good, the build in microphone picks up a ton of sound, which is impressive.<br><br>Installation was pretty easy.  Once installed, I saw it reported my voltage as being ""very poor.""  After an hour or so, the voltage reported as just ""Poor""... then it improved to ""Good"", and about an hour later, ""Very good.""  The stock doorbell transformer was a 16VAC-10VA, which apparently is under-powered for what the Ring Pro wants.  Swapping the transformers out is easy, however the the Ring should never have reported ""Very Good"" when it was only getting half the wattage it wants.  This seems like a software bug to me.<br><br>My biggest complaint is sometimes flaky live view performance.  I've seen my screen hang at ""Activating Device"" multiple times when attempting to view the live feed.  All-in-all, I'm pretty pleased with it.  Hoping that with future software updates the limited issues I have will get worked out.

  Very easy to install. My husband was able to get it wired to the existing doorbell and set up in about 30 minutes. My existing doorbell still rings, but it's delayed by about a second. Not really a problem. It is aimed at the street, so initially I was getting an alert every time a car went by. Changed the setting to people only and now it's only sending alerts for bodies. Much better.<br><br>The only thing I'm still working on is the audio. I can hear whoever is at the door with no problem. But my voice to them is a bit muffled. I'm going to have to figure out why that is. Other than that, I'm very pleased.

  Got my Ring Video doorbell the end of March, waited to write a review 5 months. It does what is advertised, but needs to be faster, if your older like me. The push alert comes quickly, but by the time I put on my reading glasses and view anything the people are walking away. The doorbell does have great features though, the night vision is very good and the motion sensing is excellent.<br>We recently bought an Echo Show and put the Ring skill on the Echo, now we can view the front door much faster.

  To anyone who reads this....<br>The past year has seen challenges with personal security.  Given that I travel for a lot and my wife works from home, we purchased this based on a coworkers recommendation and experience.  Because of the features and data recording, both my wife and I feel better about having more security.  We just lost our dog and the house is very quiet.  The ring helps both of us with the ability to screen and monitor activity (which is essential).<br>This lead me to a really cool fact!  I installed our Pro on a Saturday.  Sunday we messed with the programming.  Very early, Monday morning, we were alerted by the audible chime on our phones that Ring recorded activity.  Thinking it was the local newspaper delivery or late arriving neighbor, we dismissed it.  However, after reviewing the footage, we learned that Ring picked up a METEOR that shot across the sky.  Across 3 states to be exact and it was not a small meteor.  Our ring was one of only a few sources to record the event.  This was because of the motion sensor picking up the contrast in the sky.  It was spectacular.  Enough said.  We appreciate the Ring for what it does, the flexibility of programming and shared notifications.  Sorry for the long review... I hope you find it worthy.

  I have had the Ring Pro for 1 week. So far I have had a great experience. Installation was easy. The hardest part was installing the pro power kit on the internal doorbell, which is still not difficult. The entire installation with the power kit, replacing the outside doorbell and connecting to the app took about 1 hour.<br><br>The motion sensitivity can be adjusted but on the highest setting, I will get alerts for every car that drives by the house as well as any cat, dog or person that walks on the sidewalk or up to the door. Video quality is great. I have already been able to turn door to door sales people away without interrupting family time. This has also been effective in being able to know when a package is delivered and sitting on the doorstep.<br><br>I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple reasons. First, I don't really understand the purpose of being able to set up multiple zones for notifications if you cannot adjust the sensitivity per zone. It's better off to just have one big zone. Also, on occasion I have received a notification and there was a delay in being able to view the activity real-time.<br><br>However, for the most part this has been a great purchase and served my purpose of being notified of front door activity and also being able to communicate with someone at my door remotely. If this product continues to work as it should, I will most likely come back and purchase extra security cameras.

  I have had a video doorbell before but I needed to replace it and was deliberating between  Ring Pro and Nest Hello, eventually I decided to go with the Ring Pro more so as I am pretty much tied into the Alexa ecosystem so it seemed a better fit.<br>I am hoping that Ring gets facial recognition soon like Nest. I worked alongside a friend of mine in installing the Ring pro and spoke to Ring support a couple of times to ensure that we were doing the right thing. The customer support was AMAZING! They were patient and absolutely knowledgeable about the product and took time in explaining us through the process. We completed it and it works well. I say it's solid because it does not lose its connection like my previous doorbell and I can connect quickly to see any motion alerts or to answer. I am loving it!!! I am hoping that it gets more integrated with Alexa so that you can answer the doorbell from the Echo Spot or Show. That would be awesome!!! Also Alexa telling you...""Someone is at the door""<br>GET THOSE FEATURES NOW RING :))<br>Some points to note:<br>Get a proper transformer for it, there is one recommended when you purchase on Amazon, get it. ELK 24v 40VAC I believe.<br>This is crucial especially if you have an existing chime. If you don't have an existing chime there is another part that you need that will have to be shipped to you to bypass the chime. Speak to customer service about it if that is your situation before purchase so you can be sure.<br>Note this assumes you have a WIRED doorbell. If you don't then it is the WRONG option. Check another Ring product which is wireless.<br>Call Customer Support if necessary. They are 24/7 and reallllllly helpful. Trust me on that! Enjoy! I highly recommend it!

There are just better products on the market they do not cost a service fee I don’t mind it up charge for extra but it should at least it’s a bare minimum do what it supposed to do for free there is zero recording for free it will ring and you can see who’s there and that’s it and because of the sensitivity it will go off when the wind blows the car drives by the bird flies and someone knocks on the door.

  Purchased this doorbell three weeks ago and finally got it set up.  If people only knew one thing - it all depends on your internet speed - the upload speed.  Again, the upload speed, not the download speed.  If you do not have at least 1 Mega bits on your upload, this will not work.  We did not have that.  First we thought our modem was not enough so we purchased a new modem.  We still could not get the video to work so then we were told it was our internet.  We had ATT DSL.  We attempted to switch to ATT Uverse and were told by their reps that this would be enough speed so the doorbell would work.  The technician that came out to install the Uverse told us we would still not get the upload speed we needed.  So, we ditched ATT and went with Comcast for our internet service only.  We had to go to their 2nd tier plan to get the upload speed.  Now it works great and so does our internet!  The video is really good and allows you to zoom in to see a persons face really clear.  The voice/sound is okay but that has more to do with the covers on our Ipad covering the speakers.  Overall, I'm thrilled with this new security doorbell.  It was easy to wire in and easy to set up with our Apple products.  If I have any problems, I will come back and state them.

  New user so I am still evaluating. So far the Ring Pro was easy to install. Had to adjust viewing area so it did not register every passing car.  Also adjusted motion sensitivity for reflections and motion of plants in breezes. The image resolution is really good. Have a motion light above front door so night image from camera is enhanced. So far, the only inconvenience is you have to have your phone with you (at home) if you want to see who is at the door when Ring sends notice.

It was my bad that I didn’t realize manufacturing defects are only covered for a year but to only offer me 50 dollars off so I can buy another one because you used cheap rubberized black plastic for the button instead of something with a more reasonable thermal gradient. That’s on you. Either use rigid plastic, metal, or at least a lighter color. This is supposed to be your pro model. Not the ‘I have to buy a new one every year as a solution’ model.<br><br>Edit: Jason from Ring contacted me and after finding out the damage occurred during the warranty period was able to offer me a replacement at no extra charge.

  First of all, the item came well packed.  It included everything needed for the installation - right down to the cement bit and little screwdriver!  It's obvious they thought of everything that might be needed for the install.  Some have complained about the transformer issue.  I checked my transformer first, and thought I might also have to change that to the newer one.  The transformer had 10VAC stamped on it.  It was correctly wired, and when I tested the voltage, it was actually 20VAC.  So, no need to change that!  So far, we have been very happy with it, and have no complaints.  We bought this one so that we could focus the activity zone to ignore traffic on our busy road.  It's working great!

  It’s a nice product when it works but for the most part it doesn’t. If someone rings the door or a motion alert is received, by the time it is connected the person has already left again.

I also have the lights and I have the same issues to connect. Also, the lights go even on when bugs buzz around the camera even with the sensitivity level at the lowest and set to people only.

  I had been contemplating making the investment in a video doorbell for quite a while but the cost was keeping me on the fence until packages started disappearing from neighbors porches and I came home one day to find a screen removed from one of the front windows (someone attempting to break in).  Peace of mind suddenly seemed to outweigh the cost.<br>I actually bought 2 video doorbells, this one (the pro) for the front door and an older less ""high tech"" model for the side door that isn't used as often. Both of them were installed pretty easily and both of them appeared to be working quite well when they were first installed.<br>The video quality and motion detection on this one is obviously much improved over the older model, but I expected that and was okay with it because (like I said) we don't use my side door as much. The cost of the older model is also significantly less than this one. (You get what you pay for????)<br>The first problem I encountered was with the pro model.  When someone would press the button to ring the doorbell, it would ring on my Ring app first and then in the house a few seconds later.  A little odd, but I can work with that.<br>The second problem began a few hours after it was up and running. Every time the doorbell button was pressed, it would ring normally, then approximately once a minute it would randomly start ringing on it's own - indefinitely.  Both my teenager and my dogs were in non-stop whine mode as I frantically tried to troubleshoot the problem.  The temporary fix that I discovered was that if I hit the doorbell button a 2nd time when this happened, it would stop.  That might be a semi-acceptable work-around if it only happened when we were actually home, but if it was to happen when we were out of the house, that means the doorbell would continuously ring until we finally came back home. That is NOT acceptable.<br>After much troubleshooting and many online forums, I finally figured out I could hard reboot the device and start over.  This actually did fix the nonstop ringing issue.<br>However, then came problem number 3.  And this is the one that is about to make me disconnect both video doorbells along with the entire Ring alarm system, pack them all back up in a box and ship them back.....  it will not stay online!!!<br>It's not the voltage, it's not the wifi, it's not the power to the transformer. I have checked all of these.  I have checked all of the wiring.  The device health status actually reads, ""Your wifi signal strength and power level of your Doorbell Pro are good. Your Doorbell Pro could be offline due to a power outage, temporary internet outage in your area or if you have recently changed the password to your wifi network.  If there is not a power outage in your area, and your internet is working, reconnect your Doorbell Pro to your wifi network manually by selecting the reconnect to wifi option""  then it asks me if the information was helpful.<br>No.  No, it was not helpful at all.  If it was a power outage or a wifi issue, none of my Ring devices would work.  Like I said, I have 2 doorbells and an entire alarm system.  My house has so many windows and doors we're talking an over $1200 alarm system.  And this one single doorbell doesn't work.  It's not my power, not my wifi, it's this stupid device.<br>And in order to reconnect to the wifi you actually have to be physically standing right next to the doorbell to do it.  That is not even remotely helpful when I'm trying to monitor any suspicious activity or package thieves while I'm AWAY from home.<br>I have had this particular doorbell pro for about 3 days and I think it might have been ""online"" for a total of 12 hours combined in those 3 days.  WORTHLESS!

  The picture/video quality is outstanding.  The m otion detection depending on your location may need adjustment.  It is truly a great feature that this model allows you to determine the field of motion detection.  The motion sensor unrestricted detected vehicles going by on the street well over 100 feet away.  One negative is the VERY tiny screws that attach the RING unit itself to the angled mounting plate.  Difficult to insert in recessed configuration of the unit.  A plus is that an extra tiny screw was provided.  Last note would be that the pricing on the PRO is too high compared to other RING models and especially to the competition's models.  I would not buy the PRO as a second unit for another door as price is too high, but I would buy a less expensive RING unit for a second door if needed or desired.

  My home is set up in such a way that I have no windows affording me a view of my front door.  I put a peep hole in the door but it distorts and the view isn't the best.  Ring was the answer to my dilemma.  Delivery was fast and the instructions were great.  Installation was a snap.  My wife was totally impressed.  We synced the Rind doorbell to Alexa and can now answer the door with a terrific view of who's there.  It's a safe and effective way to determine whether we actually want to answer the door.  A super feature is the ability to talk to the person ringing.  The Ring also senses motion and alerts me to anyone/anything in its field of view.  Like I said, great security.  And I can play back a video on my phone and see what caused the motion.  Finally, I have the ability to see and speak to someone ringing my doorbell from work which is a wonderful feature.  This has been a totally worthwhile purchase and I am now looking into installing another camera that can link to Ring.  Great product!

  I like ^almost^ everything about this doorbell:<br>* Installation and setup was easy enough.<br>* It rings my indoor mechanical chime immediately.<br>* Motion detection works like a champ.<br>* Motion zones are great for keeping unimportant movement from triggering an event.<br>* Notices from the app (iOS, Android &amp; Win10) for ring or motion events are instantaneous.<br>* Did I mention motion detection works like a champ? :)<br><br>What I don't like:<br>* You can't change the outdoor chime<br>* You can't turn off motion detection. You can turn off app alerts for motion, but the events still get stored. Working the front lawn? Be prepared for a boatload of motion events you'll have to clean up later.<br>* There's a monthly fee (I knew this in advance).

  Beware the required internet connection speed is not posted on the Amazon product page or the product webpage and needs to be 2 Mbps (upload) to work even though the app asks if your speeds are above 1 Mbps. If your internet speed does not meet the 2 Mbps you will get blank black videos and the remote device may never connect to the doorbell. Support will just apologize that the internet speed requirement was not relayed better, but this is a critical component of this device to work! This information should be readily available for all considering this device.<br><br>Update: this doorbell has died. Have called support a couple of times, with the first response that it was an old power pack and they sent a new one, second time said it needed to charge, but after several days to charge it provided the same LED code after confirming the wiring, and not the unit  will not respond to anything.<br><br>Update no 2 - After a few calls and attempts to reconnect the original doorbell, Ring has shipped a replacement doorbell. As long as the new doorbell will work like the first one did originally, I’ll be buying more cameras to add to the system.

  Profound disappointment. Brand new out of the box. Installed per the instructions. Good power in 16v-24v range. None of four different devices I monitored ever saw the Ring-a9c36d WIFI SSID the device was to broadcast for app connection and setup. After multiple attempts the Setup button didn’t start setup process, no audio, no white ring chase around the doorbell. Power cycled via breaker panel.  Spent an hour on the phone with level 1 and level 2 support, tried 20-second setup button reset and delete of device from app - Setup button still not starting setup.  Only suggestion from tech support is for me to wrestle with a return/replacement.  Going to be TWO WEEKS before replacement arrives.  Already chiseled wood molding out of front door frame. Nice.  Also have a substantial amount of Ring Alarm system devices purchased to setup, confidence level is dramatically low, given experience with the flagship Ring Video Pro Doorbell.  Will have to find time to attempt the alarm setup as well, so I have time to return those as I discover other dead-out-of -the-box defective items, which at this point I certainly expect to discover. Truly disappointed.

  Ring customer service is awful. They hung up twice on my licensed electrician. Ring sent 2 defective units. 2 different electricians confirmed that we have 22 gauge 4 pair wiring to the doorbell button and the power at the button is 22.1 volts, which is right in the recommended 16-24 volt requirements in the specs. Our transformer is also brand new. We are hooking it to an existing mechanical chime, but when we replace our standard doorbell, everything works fine. We think the included power pack that hooks up to the transformer in the mechanical chime is the sub-standard part. Regardless, I am still waiting to hear from Amazon and Ring as to how we get a full refund, now that the return window has closed...which happened only because we had to exchange the original, only to get a second (used, no less) unit sent out to us. This caused the return window to lapse.

  I bought this product during the Prime sale.  In typical Amazon fashion I received the product in no time.  I follow all the instructions to the letter and the device worked for about 30 minutes and then freezes.  I call Ring and they are very nice to speak with.  After trying everything under the Sun they recommend I return the device.  I do that and request a replacement, I guess the Prime sale cleaned them out because it was backordered for several weeks.  The new one arrives and I work with Ring over the phone from step 1.  It takes over 1.5 hours to set up the device because it wasn't working with my router, we had to change the settings so my router would always allow ring port through.  A week goes by and the Ring doorbell just stops working.  The light on the device just has a constant round white, which means it is charging the device.  Again, I call Ring and they are very nice and after 30 minutes they inform me they are going to replace the device.  The agent says he will give me a brand new one, usually they only provide refurbished ones.  I am informed I will have it in 5 days, well 5 days goes by and nothing.  I call Ring again and the agent has to call shipping, he says ""There isn't a tracking number and it hasn't even shipped, it should go out in another 48 hours.  Call us back then if you don't get a notification email""<br><br>I am still waiting for the replacement and my 30 day return period is ticking away .  I have an Arlo camera system and it literally took 10 minutes to set that up and I have never had any issues.  I truely believe there is something wrong with this particular product.  Maybe the battery versions are better, but I would stay away from this item.

  I really like this product. However it does have some drawbacks. The sound quality in both directions is kind of poor and the volume is very low. This is especially true when there's a UPS or FedEx truck idling on the street. The drivers usually have trouble hearing me speaking through the doorbell. The cloud services great, especially the ability to email the video to somebody.  As far as the motion detection is concerned, it's still a bit sketchy I get several alarms and every time I look at the video I don't see any activity at my front door even though the zones are as small as possible to only include my door. This seems to need some work.  But all in all, I think this is a three star product with room for growth and I totally love the concept.

  The doorbell was very easy to install, maybe 15 minutes. The setup was quick, including the Alexa integration. The zone and sensitivity setting took a few tries and now doesn’t have any false alarms. The cons, it says my WiFi is weak, yet I show full bars on my phone. This causes a slight delay in the notification. I will have to work on either getting a repeater or something to increase the signal. I also don’t really like being held to a monthly fee (however small) for storage of video. There are other doorbells that don’t charge.

  Here's what the company doesn't tell you about the Ring Video Pro Doorbell. First, if your wired doorbell transformer doesn't have 16 volts and 30 volt amps, you will need to update your transformer (costs about $25-30). Second, if you don't have high-speed internet, the video image of the person ringing your doorbell will take up to 5 minutes to load--long after whoever was there has left and completely defeating the purpose of the product. Customer service told me to purchase a WiFi extender (for another $50) to correct this problem, but another company representative said this actually would have made my internet speed even slower, and that the doorbell will never work as intended.<br><br>Bottom line: the concept for this doorbell is great, but the execution is dismal, and I'm returning the product.

It is very frustrating and I wish I had gone with a different video doorbell.<br>Another annoying thing is that when someone does ring the doorbell, the connection is delayed so it is about a full minute before you would actually be able to talk to the person through the video if you are not home.<br>I would not recommend this to a friend.

  We bought our Ring Pro with the hopes of knowing when packages were delivered on our porch before the holiday season got in full swing.  We received the device on Friday, and with our hectic schedule I finally got around to installing it on Monday night.  I carefully read the instructions and watched several videos on installation to ensure I was getting things right.  Being very comfortable around working with electricity, I had no expectations that there would be anything wrong or to be feared on that front, so off to the installation.  I did have to drill a new hole in my brick for the mounting screw, but the special masonry bit was also included in the package - very helpful.  Everything went as I expected until hooked up the unit on the front porch and applied power - the front light would spin in circles but it would never go into set up mode or provide a Wi-Fi signal to start the process (even after multiple resets or power disconnects.  To make a long story short, over the period of several days, I worked with Ring Support testing this and that and wound up replacing my 15VA transformer to a 30VA transformer.  In the end, it was determined that the actual device was defective.  Ring promptly shipped out a replacement unit and it worked out of the box like I expected it to.  I have nothing but good things to say about each of the multiple Ring Phone support staff that I spoke to along this Journey.  Once the set-up issue was out of the way, everything worked like we had hoped it would.  The adjustable motion zones, HQ video &amp; audio recordings and the night vision ability really give a good sense of security for us.  Glad we did not give up on a great product.

The motion detection area is configurable and it was impressive that if I set the area too large, it even picked up cars as they drove by. Video quality is clear and faces are clearly visible.

  The product is GREAT once you get it to work in your environment.  Sellers should post the following:<br>1.  Don't buy unless you have a very good wifi signal at the spot where the doorbell will be placed.  If it's less than 2 mbps on upload, you may need a wifi extender or upgraded internet service.  Your IPS provider should have a link to a speed test site in order to assess this issue.  I'm installing a fairly cheap extender.  Some people have reported devoting a router exclusively for this device.<br>2.  Power source is a big deal.  Even if your transformer is within the 16-24V range, you need to look at the loads on the circuit that houses the transformer.  In my case, the circuit also served a small refrigerator that diminished the voltage available for the doorbell.  After moving the fridge to another circuit, it resolved my connectivity problems.  Ring should include this possibility in their troubleshooting menu.<br>3.. I've only owned this product for 3 days, and am very happy with the result after making corrections outlined above.  Expect some startup issues, though.  There is an operational window that needs to be conformed with.

Adjusting to 5 stars.<br><br>If this worked liked it was supposed to, it would be 5 stars. I will preface these issues saying that we have Gigafiber internet with ""Good"" connection in the device health screen for WiFi connection. Voltage is ""Very Good"".  Purchased 4/5/17 and everything worked great for a few weeks with the exception of the slow mechanical doorbell sound, which wasn't a big deal.<br>Now we have multiple issues:<br>1. Won't load live video when doorbell has been pressed.  Continually spins the loading icon. Video then shows up for review later on which doesn't help you speak to someone at your door like advertised.<br>2. Doorbell button has cracked already.<br>3. Indoor chime that connects to mechanical doorbell, at best is about a 2 second delay, at worst it doesn't ring at all.<br>4. No longer receive notifications on our phone that the doorbell has been pressed.<br>5. Random video picture outages on recorded videos, with no notification that anything has stopped working.  Basically it's sound with a black screen on archived videos. No idea anything is wrong until you go back to review videos.<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Motion sensing area is a neat feature that works well as far as I can tell.<br>2. Service plan is reasonably priced and videos are stored for a decent amount of time.<br><br>Summary: These need to built heavier duty, with stronger WiFi. $250 is not acceptable for something that lasted a month. I've entered a ticket with Ring for these issues and if this unit is defective, I will update the review.

  It wasn't clear what can be done with a Ring Pro if you don't subscribe to their monitoring service.  I've discovered that basically you can get live view only in their app and usually live view on an Echo Show.  Even then I found the app (or maybe it's the service) not particularly reliable.  I've had to remove and re-add the Alexa skill and even had to uninstall and reinstall the Android app.  As a closed system, it should be far cheaper as Ring will make their money in the virtually essential pay for service.  They're basically using the razor blade model, but with an expensive handle (the doorbell itself).  I will probably return or resell it at this point and get something that allows me to control and manage recordings using my own equipment instead some pay service.

  I just had the doorbell installed last week. It seems to function as described. There are occasional false motion alerts. Car headlights backing into driveways from across the street seem to be responsible for most false motion alerts. My only disappointment so far is that my doorbell will not work with the doorbell pro. Ring sent me a free chime. I am very pleased with the ring community support. It is now August 2nd and I have had the doorbell pro since June 9th. It has been an amazing product. I just purchased a wifi extender that covers 10,000 square feet. My thinking was that even if it only covers 3,000 square feet it would do the job. The I Phone now responds in clear photos within 3 seconds of touching the ring app. There is no time lag of the doorbell. I think most problems are caused by slow wifi connections.

  Picture quality is great. However, the audio is horrible. You cannot listen to whoever is at the front door and they can't hear you back. The audio connection is always choppy. Even with good voltage, strong WiFi and Gig Speed with ISP. Ring will blame your router, ISP or circuit brake.<br><br>Doing basic troubleshooting is a hassle, you always need to have your screwdriver ready or shut down the electrical breaker. There's no option in the app to do a remote reboot which will be great instead of messing with electric or disassembling the unit.

  Our new RING Video Doorbell Pro works great and the video is awesome.  Replacing our existing doorbell took about 15 minutes and was very simple.

  Purchased the Ring Video Doorbell Pro during the Amazon Prime Day event.  It was a Great deal!  Since I had previously installed the Ring Doorbell 2, I was feeling good about the installation of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  However, after reading the details, there was a Pro power kit installation that was necessary.  This was a little different from the Ring Doorbell 2 install.  After locating the internal doorbell box and installing the Pro power kit (It requires you to turn off the doorbell breaker at the breaker box), the install was relative easy to finish.  The Ring Video Doorbell Pro connects to my 5GHz WiFi signal and I recieve a great high quality video/picture of my entry way.  Highly recommend the product!

  Pro is better than the Video Doorbell if you have the WiFi to support heavier data stream.<br><br>I had the Video Doorbell for about 5 months before upgrading to the Pro. Pro has better video quality, but still has a delay to motion detection time. The app will show two videos a minute apart from each other each time someone is walking near the Pro - one will have a person at the door, the other will be empty space. Not a major issue if unless you have motion detection alerts on.<br><br>My major grip with Pro is my doorbell now has a 1-2 second delayed response time before my house chimes to alert me of someone at the door. The app and Ring Chime device will sound off before my house chime does.<br><br>NOTE: Before purchasing the Pro, make sure your doorbell is hardwired and can support the power requirements of the Pro.  Setup is a tad more complex compared to the Video Doorbell, but nothing too complicated if you watch the setup videos a few times. If you already have the Video Doorbell, you can transfer your remaining cloud service to Pro through Ring's customer service.

  Set up video and instructions made everthing so easy.

Due to the height of the Doorbell Pro and the height of the outlet box, I didn't have enough stucco to drill for the molley screws (see attached before and after pictures).<br><br>Thanks to the ""Ring Users Group"" on Facebook  who gave me the idea of attaching a new colored faceplate from Home Depot, then attaching the Doorbell Pro to this faceplate with 4 strips of velcro, also bought from Home Depot.<br><br>It looks great, is more than securely attached and has been working wonderfully.  I have 4 FloodCams and the 1 Doorbell Pro.  We can hardly wait until Ring comes out with their new interior security system.  I am a fan of Ring, their products and their customer service.

Now I’ve had the ring doorbell pro for approximately two years when suddenly it stopped working. Went through troubleshooting steps with Ring Tech and it was determined I need a new doorbell (unit doesn’t power up). Best Ring offered was a 35% discount on a new one because they stated unit only has a 1 year warranty. With an expensive unit like this I would expect to get better life out of the unit than 2 years. I also was unable to purchase a new unit while on the phone because Ring customer service representative stated I have to wait several days to receive the discount code.

  Instead of ""Ring Video Doorbell Pro"", it should be called ""Your phone is having trouble connecting to Ring Video Doorbell Pro"".  I have verified that there is a strong wifi signal (-54 to -61 dbm), the phone(s) have verified strong signals (either on wifi or on 3/4G), and upstream bandwidth is 5+ Mbps.  Despite that, the majority of the times that we have a ring or motion event, the app is unable to connect, and will only allow us to review the historical event/recording, rather than get to the Ring when it actually occurs.  Consider a Nest or other product instead.

  We've always wanted to try this doorbell out, but the price was a little steep for a ""doorbell"". We finally had to reason to buy it when we were constantly ding dong ditched by some kids almost 2 times a day for a straight 2 weeks. So we bit the bullet and bought the product. Installation was simple. The pro doesn't have a battery pack like the original ring so it has to be hard wired (but that was fine for us, not having to charge the battery every once in awhile)<br><br>So long story short we caught the kids on camera and we were finally left alone! Ring pro works! The image was clear enough to make out the kid's face.<br><br>The only part I am disappointed in is. How fast it actually detect moving objects. Now if someone is on my porch it normally detects them as they're about to ring the doorbell which is alright, sometimes we get it after they ring the doorbell. Now I know that falls under my internet connect, but my wifi signal/speed is pretty fast (at least fast enough for ring) now I can't simply ""switch"" out my wifi to see if it's my internet or ring but overall I am happy with my purchase

  Since we only had a 12VAC transformer, we couldn't use this right away. After getting that replaced, I installed the Ring Pro in the existing location at the front door, and it was great! Until the next few days, everytime I attempted to connect with the Live View (or answer door bell) via the app on my Android phone, I would get an error message: ""We're having trouble connecting to your Doorbell Pro"". Upon further debugging, I suspected that the wifi signal was not strong enough. Even though I would consistently get 5-10 mbps up and down when testing. Okay, so i moved the router from a rear room, into our living room. It is about 30-40 feet away from the front door. Room is fairly open, with a wall or two in the way. I use a signal meter app on my phone, and it reports great signal at the same position the doorbell is mounted. The Device Health reports Signal Strength of ""Good"", with a range of RSS 54 - 62, depending upon the time of day. Right now it is at 54, and I cannot connect live. I can connect to the Event History recordings just fine. I have an ASUS RT-AC68U router, which performs great. It just seems that the Ring will only work when the router is right next to it! That or upgrade to another router. Just wish they would make a product with a greater wifi interface. No problems streaming hi-res videos on my phone, even 10-20 feet into my front yard!

  The first Ring Pro I received proved to be faulty, but the folks at Ring provided a replacement unit shipped to my door in about a week. Installation was very easy. This new one works very well- except when there are connection issues. I have a WiFi extender just on the inside of the door and there is a strong signal, but from time to time the notifications are delayed. This could be the WiFi and could be phone reception, so I'm not blaming Ring for this. I'd say 80% of the time it works flawlessly. Even when delayed I appreciate having the recording of who was at my door.

  First, they don't tell you you have to upgrade your doorbell transformer.  Which takes either a very competent friend or an electrician hired at $200/hour.  Then as it turns out they sent me a substandard product that they flagged for replacement 6 months ago, but didn't tell me until it died.  They sent a replacement, but now they don't support the PC app to set it up.  I have no smartphone.  I do have an Amazon tablet, but they aren't compatible.  (Why this is, since Amazon owns Ring, I don't know.)  So now I'm left with a very expensive doorbell that has no video and I'm out the money.  Beyond upset.

  I was impressed at the moment of opening the packaging.  Very organized, easy to follow instructions,  and they had seemingly thought of every detail- even including a screw driver and a drill bit you might need for drilling into brick or mortor.  The on-line videos were very well done and easy to follow.  I watched several times before doing the install.  Once I figured out which breaker switch cut power following the install instructions was a breeze.  Toughest part was drilling a hole in my brick to mount it - but even that was not bad.  Even easier to install the extra chime I purchased for our second floor.  I gave the app and settings a test drive and also tested out door bell, intercom/speaker, live video etc...all worked well.  Takes a little but for video to upload to cloud, but not terrible.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see that there was an option to link ring to my ADT pulse security/home automation system.  That was super easy as well.  I don't normally write reviews but I was do pleased with this process that I had to leave some feedback.  I may update my review after we use this for a while...but as of first evdning to have it installed - I am extremely happy.  Way to get it right, Ring.  :-)

  Camera's will not take you to a live view when you need it. Say you need to see what's going on around your house - so you go to open the app to see the live feed. Oh, sorry, Ring doesn't allow you to go to the live view quickly. They default to your past history events. It requires several clicks to get to your live view (you know, something you buy security cameras for.) In an emergency, these extra clicks could be detrimental. I reached out to Ring and they did this on purpose and have no intent of changing it. So, fair warning.

I love that Ring video's the entire time and stores it so you can look back to see if needed.  There is a 30 day trial and after that there is a $30 a year fee.  So reasonable for piece of mind.

When I added a remote Chime Pro accessory in my shop to monitor the front door, the camera quit working well (camera signal strength decreased to a poor level).  This is becuase the Chime Pro, with it's integral network bridge function, is limited to 2.4G.  When you connect it to the doorbell, it creats a new newtork that limits both devices to 2.4G.

  Costumer service is great. They tried very hard to fix the problems I was having. But unless you have the perfect lighting then likely your Ring pro will not automatically change between color to black and white (night vision). My front door faces west and I have a covered porch (probably like most do). It is nothing huge, only a few feet, but because of this the camera would think it was still dark outside even in the middle of the day. This resulted in a barely visible picture where people weren't recognizable. Customer service tried to fix it from their end and the replacement part had the same issue. To temporarily switch it back to color, I would have to reset the breaker, but eventually it would again get ""stuck"" in black and white. When it did work it was amazing, but again if you don't have the perfect lighting than this is not for you. Maybe after software updates etc this will be a better product.

  Most of everything starts working after fiddling and giving it time (for whatever reason). It becomes quite ineffective as soon as the trial for cloud gets over. The company is clever as you can't opt out of the trial to see how it will be within the first 30 days effectively taking you over the return window. Without the cloud you can never watch the first few seconds before you get the alert, that additional $30 a year killed it for me. If they were like Kuna or Skybell HD with a free cloud recording time, I'd have kept the pro. The night vision range is limited to a few feet in front of the bell. Not much help for anything beyond 5ft or so.<br><br>If you do decide to purchase this, make sure where you'll install it, to go take your phone and do a Speedtest from there to ensure speed and wifi signal is enough. You'll only get 1080p if your wifi signal strength is strong. Again for something price @ $250, and having to pay $30 every year for cloud recording is unacceptable when all other competitors offer free recording to some extent, without the cloud recording this product is sub par @ $250.

  This product provides peace of mind not only when we are away from the house, but also while we are at the house. As a female, I don't like opening the door for people I don't know, so this allows me to see and speak to people at the door without opening it to strangers. Very easy to set up, is app is very user friendly and walks you through the process. We had it installed and running in about 30 minutes. The videos are very clear, they alert you right away to motion. I like the motion setting, where we can pick the area we want motion-sensored, and how sensitive we want it. It was going off a little too often with every car that passed by, so we lowered the motion and now it's only people coming up our walk way and the occasional car. What I really like about it is that we can check motion alerts from earlier in the day, so I can check a recording and see why it started recording at different times while I was away (delivery, or someone walking by the house, etc...). I like this feature in case someone is scoping out the house (we've had some instances in our neighborhood), we can be more aware of it.

  I normally don’t write reviews BUT I had to for this. It’s been a year now and not even half of the year it was already dying so quick even with changing the settings to sleep during the day since I’m home and it still died. I literally had to take the cover off to reset on the side button because the app was saying poor connection/ weak battery. Today it won’t turn on at all. Now I know why this product was on the Amazon Big Yearly sale. Most friends we know have the 2nd generation which you have to replace the battery and it’s still up and running, guess I’ll have to get that since I’m already paying the subscription.

  The Ring doorbell pro worked great for a month and then it started ringing randomly after that. It would ring for an hour straight one night and after talking to support, who basically asked me to constantly do the same thing over and over again it still has the same problem, of course I disconnected it and tried to reinstall the ring with no success.  Now I have ring video but a disconnected main bell. The canned question/answer from support was compatibility issues with my chime/doorbell, but I have one on their “approved” list. I took a chance to buy the more expensive model and have been severely disappointed. Of course it’s too late to return via amazon so I will have to continue to deal with customer service.

  There have been some car burglaries and porch pirates in the neighborhood and we got this as a deterrent.  We've had it for a week or two and so far so good. It catches deer and postmen and my neighbors going to work.  I definitely have to adjust the sensitivity, but for now it's only a minor nuisance.  (There are settings to calibrate it, I've just been lazy)<br>My only real gripes have been that while most home accessories default to white, I found that I have to order the white face plate and mounting wedge separately.  Come on. For the price of this thing would it have killed you to add the most common face plate with the damn product?  Additionally, the built-in level isnt correct.  First attempt ended up crooked, had to fill the holes with dowels and walk them over a hair.  When I tightened down the wedge it flexed a bit so theres a gap between it and the ring.  I primed it before I put it up, I'll fill the gaps with calk and paint it when we get a nice day, but still frustrating.

  I had high hopes about this video doorbell (Ring Video Pro doorbell).  I read countless reviews, and did a lot of research (i.e., YouTube).  I decided to take the plunge.<br><br>After receiving the product, I checked the voltage/amperage requirement at the transformer I would be using (check).  I installed the ""power gizmo"" in my existing doorbell box (check). I downloaded the Ring application (check).  I carefully followed the instructions (check) as outlined in the Ring App (check).  I also queried my WiFi signal  I have a TPLink Deco M9 mesh with 3 transceivers...one of which is approximately 6 ft from the doorbell mounting site.  It showed ""excellent"" signal strength (5/5 bars) and good upload/download numbers at the proposed mounting site and out to the street in front of my house (check).  Holding my breath, I exited the ""Setup"" program, and tried the doorbell.  It worked fine! Clear, sharp video (check), adequate motion detection (check), ability to query it from an Alexa Echo Show 5 (check).  No problem with connecting to the WiFi that I have (check).<br><br>The doorbell worked fine for 2 weeks, then died!  There is NO problem in motion detection, or sounding my original doorbell.  But...no video, and the doorbell cannot (or will not) connect to the WiFi (nothing has changed with the WiFi...same username and password).  Even the Ring App cannot ""find"" the Ring doorbell, as it easily did before!  After approx 10 attempts of resetting and going through the setup procedure, I finally added a Ring Chime module.  It programmed just fine, and instantly recognizes (and connects to) my WiFi, and recognizes the Ring Pro doorbell.  However, the Ring Pro does not work ... and does not connect to either the Ring Chime module or to the WiFi (despite confirmation of ""excellent"" signal strength, as before).  The error message continues to be ""Cannot connect to WiFi, signal strength (of the WiFi) too low"".  And, it makes no difference if I route the doorbell to the WiFi directly, or through the Ring Chime module.  Same result.<br><br>I have trouble-shot the Ring Pro (and also the Ring Chime) endlessly over the last couple of MONTHS...with the same result.  I even completely disconnected (several times) the Ring Pro and, after ~ 30-60 minutes, reconnected it and tried to perform a ""fresh"" setup ... to no avail!  Same result.<br><br>I am discouraged and VERY annoyed.  And I suspect that the Ring Pro unit itself is a defective unit.  The problem certainly does NOT exist in my house (e.g., wiring ... the voltage, as read by a Fluke multimeter at the doorbell mounting position read 16.8 - 18.2 volts, which falls well within the range recommended by Ring), or my WiFi.  And, for that reason, I can only give the unit a 2-star rating (motion detection does seem to work...otherwise the rating would drop to ONE star!<br><br>I really, really wanted to see the Ring Pro succeed.  However, apparently there are quite a few reviewers who had a similar experience.  Failure to connect to ... and remain connected to ... a good WiFi network seems to be a very common problem.  I am now (reluctantly) investigating Eufy, Blink, Remo, and Arlo as possible replacements to the Ring Pro product.<br><br>This is an expensive video doorbell, and potential replacement of it from my own pocket is out of the question.  My hope?  To have the Ring Pro video doorbell REPLACED (at no cost for me) with a functioning unit as soon as possible!<br><br>In its current state, I cannot honestly recommend it.

  Only 4 stars! The actual product is great, but I had to go through 3 units before getting one that actually worked.<br><br>I first ordered the RIng Doorbell Pro on Prime day. After getting, installation was a breeze and getting it connected to the app was easy as well. However, several hours after installing it, it stopped working. After talking with Ring support for 30+ minutes, they declared the unit defective and had me return it. I immediately ordered a replacement unit. The second one arrived several days later and got that one hooked up and working. Just one problem, no one could hear me when I tried talking to them through the app! (A problem that seems to be common on the Doorbell Pro.) Again, on the phone with Ring support for 30+ minutes and tried several different things. Again, they determined the unit to be defective and suggested that I send it back. After the third one arrived, I finally have success! This one works and anyone at the door can actually hear me talking to them.<br><br>I would HIGHLY suggest that anyone ordering through Amazon, install your Ring Doorbell right away! If it's defective, they are great at exchanging it, but you have 30 days to do any returns through Amazon. Don't get your new Ring and let it sit around before you finally decide to install it. If it gets to be after 30 days, and it dies, they won't replace it and you will need to go through Ring.<br><br>One final note, Ring support was great in trying to assist with the problems. They asked questions, and helped with what they could. Amazon was also great in timely replacements (as long as its within the 30-day window)!

  First the install was incredibly simple. I first used a volt meter to confirm that I had a door transformer for my door bell chime that was at least 16volts. After that it was an easy install following the videos on YouTube.  The picture quality is great and the zoning control for motion detection was easy to configure.  An added plus is being able to link up the Ring Pro with the Amazon Echo and Amazon FireTV.  Now I am sending the Ring Pro video image to my TV.  However, I was surprised to note that Amazon Echo devices can't make sounds when the Ring Pro door bell is pressed or motion is detected.  It would be great to let the echo devices make a chime when the Ring Door bell is pressed.

  My one concern in setting up the doorbell was the requirement to go to the circuit breaker box and turn off the doorbell.  At my own box, the doorbell was not listed.  I searched YouTube and Googled to try and find out what would happen if I continued the installation without turning off the doorbell.  Well, I never could find the information I wanted so I decided to proceed anyway.  I needn't have been concerned.  Everything went well.<br>The wall with the doorbell is stone, therefore, an uneven surface.  I used some felt behind the doorbell housing in an effort to close the gaps and keep the elements from getting to the wiring behind the doorbell.  It would have been nice if something like that had been included with the kit.  Speaking of the kit, it also would have been nice if they had mentioned in all their marketing material about the little device that goes into your doorbell housing.  That was a surprise.  It didn't add any particular complexity, but I would have appreciated the heads up about having to disassemble my doorbell chime and insert this device.<br>Now as to the doorbell itself, I'm disappointed in the zone settings.  I set my zone to not include the street and only include the driveway.  But I still get notifications with every car that goes by.  It's annoying to have my phone chiming all day.  As to working with Alexa, it does work.  I can see my doorbell on my Echo Spot just fine.  Pretty neat.

  THE DOORBELL WORKS FINE<br><br>Literally writing this comment just for the screw issue I had. I wanted to use a corner mount to angle my doorbell. So I did all the steps and everything was fine. But I noticed that the angle mount was a little loose, so I unscrewed the screw that keeps the faceplate on, then unscrewed the screws that anchor the Ring to the actual corner mount. I adjusted the corner mount, then attempted to re-attach the Ring back onto the corner mount.<br><br>And guess what? The screws turned freely.<br><br>This is because the corner mount holes for the securing screws are small to begin with; as you screw in the securing screws for the first time, the screws are able to grab on to the plastic. HOWEVER, if you unscrew these securing screws, they actually PULL OUT PLASTIC MATERIAL along the screw threads, meaning that the screw holes are now WIDER than they were before. And since the screw has pulled out plastic material, it no longer has a physical connection with the corner mount. Meaning that there is no securing force (friction forces) that keep the screw connected to the corner mount. As a result, free-spinning screws.<br><br>Other than that. Works fine.

   The Ringo Doorbell Pro is absolutely amazing quality, easy to set up, and has some really awesome features of motion detection based on zones.  The setup took me a little over an hour because I needed to due some custom woodworking to create a backspace to push it out further and at an angle to see more of the front porch.  It also integrates with Apple watch to let you know that there is motion at your front door in case you don't have your phone immediately on you but still in range of your watch.  The Pro also has 1080P resolution which is awesome.  The motion detection is light sensitive (based on pixel contrast variance), which most motion detection cameras are based on, so if you have a porch light that is scheduled to turn on at night there is a chance depending on how bright it is, it can trigger a false alert of someone being at your door.  Large bugs can also trigger the motion detection alerts, but then again living in SC where the mosquito is the state bird (I think), I kinda can't complain.  Product is doing its job!  Besides the amazing video quality, the greatest feature is the 2 way audio.  Either welcome your friends and neighbors, or warn the idiot scoping out your place to get off your property or capture some pretty amazing mother nature moments.

Best of all, all of my grown kids have the app on their phones so they can also see what’s going on here from their own homes. Then there is the neighborhood app where other neighbors and police keep post events. Definitely gives a sense of security.

  Living alone, this item is a great tool even though I have a loud-mouth puppy who barks and howls pretty well.  The Ring Video Doorbell Pro gives me a sense of real security, especially at night.  I am not usually nervous at night but if someone were to come to the door after 11 PM I would be!  The video feature tells you right away if you know the person(s) at the door.  It's also great if you are napping:  you can easily tell whether to get up and go to the door or not.  My third and really best reason for loving this item is because I'm in a wheelchair and cannot always make it to the door in time and hate 'burning rubber' only to find out they have already left or are trying to sell something.

  The Ring doorbell only lasted about a year. Now, all it says is Front Door is offline and not capturing. Yes, i have restarted this thing over and over again. It doesn't matter what wifi bandwidth I'm using 5GHz or 2.4GHz. Even more junk from Ring is the app on the phone will work more often than the Windows 10 app. Sometimes windows 10 will work and sometimes the phone will work. Just pray every time there is an app update that the doorbell going to work. I wish i had reptiles as pets, then I could use this doorbell as a heater for them. 80 degrees outside and this doorbell is reading 130 degrees. $250 for Garbage app &amp; Garbage Doorbell.

  My first video doorbell and I like the recording function.  I don't have an indoor chime so sometimes miss the signal of someone at the door.  I've played with zones but still get more recordings than I like and occasionally miss recording something visible on another camera.  The bandwidth requirement is high which could be part of the missing images.  Would like better control over FPS, length of recording (appears to be 1 minute), and image resolution.  Integration with Echo devices is critically missing door bell chime function which I hope comes soon (e.g., make my Echo sound when someone pushes the button).

  I bought this in January 2017.  It had the best setup instructions I have ever seen for anything.  It has worked well until recently except for one minor annoyance. My front door points at a corner in the road and the headlights point directly at my front door.  Every time a car drives by at night, the light change sets off the motion sensor.<br><br>For the last few months, I have had issues with the camera occasionally only recording a few seconds of video. About 2 weeks ago it completely stopped working.  After disconnecting it from the power and reconnecting I was able to get it working for a few minutes, but since then it has been constantly restarting. It will flash blue for 30 seconds or so, and then go to solid blue.  If you push the button or try to reset the device, it will shut off and start over again.<br><br>After reading around a bit, it appears that even though the app says that the power is good, you really need to have a specific type of transformer to output the correct voltage and apparent power(VA).  There is an internal battery that degrades over time and once it stops working, the unit will need to be replaced.  Using the correct transformer will probably extend the life, but I couldn't say how much more than the 2 and a half years I got out of mine.

  Have two ring doorbell pros. The one in the front of the house stops working in the summer due to the fact it gets too hot. If you have a front door that gets sun exposure look elsewhere. Also, if you live on a busy street look elsewhere. No matter how I tweak the motion zones and settings they constantly go off in the rain due to the reflection of car lights.<br><br>Within the first three months of ownership my doorbell started ringing non stop at 1AM. I had to uninstall the device and disconnect everything in the moment so we could get back to sleep. Lots of fun digging for the special torx screwdriver to open it up at 1AM.<br><br>Ring support shipped me one decently quick. Yay, now I get to replace it on my doorbell which is at the top of a 20ft foyer ceiling.

  Although we paid for professional installation via Amazon when purchased, the individual said that the Ring wouldn’t work with the transformer that we had.  When we purchased the Ring, I don’t recall seeing any information that you needed a certain kind of transformer.  So although we paid for the installation, it isn’t installed.  I blame Ring, because there was no prerequisite for whether it would work or not on our electric doorbell.  I had the impression that if you had an electric doorbell and used the installer, it would work.

I hated that I missed visitors sometimes due to the bad chime.  Which I might add I needed to replace to get the ring pro up and running, but it was very cheap AND easy to do. No, really I paid about $13 for a new chime, and didn't even need to mess with the transformer.  I also love that I can now see who is at my door without having to peek through a window since my sidelights are obscured.  And, now I have caller ID for my front door so I can screen who I want to talk to, or let in, etc.  It'seems great for checking on who'should coming and going,l for adolescents and teenagers, too.  There is a slight delay, and the camera angle is not 180 deg. like the original so those two things would make it perfect!  As for the night view, and distance or zone of detection it is remarkable.  I have not figured out how to adjust the zones to my liking so that is the one thing that was not self explanatory to me, but certainly not a deal breaker.  The motion sensitivity, and/or reliability is not 100% accurate, but it isn't a concern either since it'should probably close to a +30 ft. distance from the front door!<br><br>I will be expanding my ring surveilance products.  However, I would also like to see a ring motion camera light with alarm and intercom speaker.  Just do it!!

  EZ setup and installation. The main problem I had was that my doorbell transformer was so old (probably from 1953 when the house was built) that it wasn't powerful enough to power the doorbell and the Ring Pro. After replacing that it worked fine and is continues to do so. The only draw back was that I had to program the Ring Pro several times before it worked properly. The Ring app walks you through the set up process, so its pretty much idiot proof.  I spoke with their Help Center several times and they were great (24/7). I found out by speaking with them that they prefer that it is linked to a 2.4g wifi signal. Also the literature does not mention that the night time view is in black and white. Worth the small hassles.

  First, let me say I have never written a review for any product ever.  But after my horrible experience with the Ring Doorbell product and even worse customer service I feel compelled to warn others.  First let me say I purchased the product in January, installed it in March and it worked fine for the first 45 days.  It then unexpectedly went offline and would not reset or reconnect.  The doorbell works fine, but the camera does not.  After calling Ring customer service and sending a number of photos, they concluded it was a transformer issue and I would need to replace the transformer. They concluded that the existing transformer wasn't working and stated the doorbell needed at least16v in order to work.  After buying a new Ring Doorbell Pro transformer on Amazon, installing it and getting a consistent 17.8v at the doorbell, it still would not reset or reconnect.  Again a call to Ring customer service, and again with photos, they claimed that that I should have bought a Ring transformer directly from them.  They claimed Amazon will sell anything and don't verify that a product listed as being built for Ring Doorbell Pro is, or that it will work (even though Amazon owns Ring).  Both times while talking with customer service they had their ""technical team"" look at the wiring configuration.  Both times they didn't know what was wrong ""have an electrician come out and look at it"".  The doorbell works, the camera/wifi capabilities do not.  My guess is a faulty product, but you can't return them after 90 days.  Long story short, I paid $200 to replace a doorbell that worked fine.  Next stop Google Nest.

  I should have listened to the other reviews. Doorbell cam is only good to look back at what happened earlier in the day. Any time an alert is sent for motion or a doorbell ring the app wont bring up a live video.

Additionally the delay from the doorbell press to when the chime in the house rings is kinda long.

  Pretty good product, and I bought this after installing my nest exterior cameras outside and they were super simple. This installation has been a disaster. I bought it, installed it and was working pretty well but wouldn’t work from time to time before it just stopped. I called ring, and they sent me a replacement unit. I will say their customer service is great but the product required much more work than I expected. I ultimately needed an upgrade of my transformer which took me a month to find. I finally found it today and upgraded it which took me a few hours since it was in my attic which isn’t easy to enter. Now if I could just figure out how to get the door bell to ring like it used to.  I wish amazon would have let me return it but it was past the return policy.

  Something I was not made aware of, AFTER I installed it (and chiseled part of my front door post to fit the wider doorbell body).  This doorbell requires at least 2 Meg upload speed to operate properly.  Apparently, everything uploads to the cloud first, then relays back to the doorbell chime, and any device you're using to view through.  That appears to be why there is a distinct delay in the time between the button being pressed and the door chime in my home ringing.  It's also apparently the reason I couldn't get the thing to operate consistently.  I'm not willing to pay an extra $20/month to upgrade my internet for a doorbell.  Had to return it.

  Install was simple. The Pro is within spitting distance of a router that delivers consistent 6000MBps up and down. The live view(when you can get it) is very clear--great quality. However, what use is this doorbell if it lags so badly that your visitor is long gone before you are notified? ""Notified"" is another issue. The app is so atrocious that I can not get alerts for more than a few hours before it stops. No notifications at all until I go to app, clear cache, force stop, and restart. Lather, rinse, repeat, twice a day, every day. Then the alerts will work on the app, but circle back to problem 1, and it lags so badly you will never actually respond to anyone live. Once you get an alert and click ""Live View"", you can watch the spinning circle, see it warn you of ""weak signal"" on your phone(as I look at my router 10 feet away and see my -35db signal), and hope it actually connects eventually for an actual live view.  It really is a piece of frustrating crap. There must be something better out there.

  After much research I recently purchased a Ring doorbell. I found the set up and installation virtually trouble free. Let me state that although I am not totally technology challenged I do often get frustrated with it. I did have small infrequent problems with false alerts even though I played with the settings often to eliminate them.<br>After 10 days I decided to return the ring and upgrade to the Ring pro, not because I was dissatisfied with the Ring, but because it was a little large for my door frame and would interfere if I later decided to add a storm door. I also liked the improvements in zone targeting as  well as the increase in resolution of the camera they have made with the Pro .<br>The Pro installation was as easy as with the Ring even with the added step of a booster that was required to be installed on the doorbell chimes. I did have an issue with hearing but not being to able to talk to the person at the door and called Ring Customer support. I was able to talk to an agent within 10-15 min (I wish I remember his name) and he was able to patiently walk me through the troubleshooting and resolution of the issue within about 20 min.<br>My wife and I are very satisfied with the quality and performance of the Ring Pro so far and plan to purchase the Ring security light in the near future .

  This takes great footage and is a really inexpensive way to keep track of what goes on in the front of our house.  The wide angle lens captures almost our entire front yard and the feature of being able to draw lines where you want the motion detector to activate makes it so we get almost no false alarms.  It also works well with multiple devices so that different people in the house can open the video on different phones.  It is occasionally glitchy and doesn't allow you always to open an alert.  I also wish there was a way to put it into motion snooze from the alert (Apple watch does allow this).  Otherwise I have to open the app, wait for it to load, then click on a motion snooze to keep from buzzing constantly when kids playing in the front yard.  Small hassle, but always annoys me.  We've already captured some helpful and funny moments such as a neighbors dog escaping and coming to our front door (they were sure the dog had been stolen).

It looks nice but just isnt loud when you're on a call or dropping in on someone.<br>The ring is not impressing me either. The settings are too sensitive but when you lower the sensativity on the motion alerts it doesnt notify you everytime when someone is standing right in front of it!

  Thought I was getting a device which provided a picture or video of someone approaching my door on my iphone.  Well it does, sort of.  The problem is when someone is detected, Ring sends an alert which when recieved requires you to open the app, select the video of the event, and wait for something to be diplayed.  This takes awhile.  By the time you actually see something, your visitor or porch pirate is long gone.  Ring does record the event so you can go back and view it as history.  Detection is another issue.  Mine either captures everything (cars, dog, birds, etc. or nothing) depending on the sensitivity you select.  Customer Support polite but of no value.  Pass on this product.

  The doorbell itself worked fine after installing for about 30 minutes. It picked up motion and sent me alerts. Then the mechanical doorbell inside started buzzing/humming. While I called tech support, the doorbell got so hot, it melted a piece of plastic on the plunger that rings the bell. After sending pictures to tech support and an hour later, they said everything was wired correctly and the doorbell was compatible, with no other solution except to send me a override/bypass kit and the plug-in chime (at no cost). When I later googled the issue, there are TONS of people who have the same issue, which appears to be that the doorbell is not getting enough power. Waiting on my parts to get here to see if the issue is resolved. At the moment, I have a non-functioning, expensive doorbell camera.

  This review relates to the customer support I got when trying to install the Pro.  It turned out that the Pro was just incompatible with my existing wiring and I didn't want to hire an electrician to rewire some stuff, so I ultimately had to swap the Pro for the Ring 2.  BUT ... their customer support was excellent.  They tried their best to work things out for me.  We communicated by email and phone.  I'd send pictures of my current doorbell wiring and they'd make suggestions as to how to integrate the Pro.  They provided free two door chimes and a Pro Cable, hoping that we could find a solution with these additional accessories.  No such luck, but I do want to praise the support I got while trying.  Am now waiting to get the Ring 2.  Hope it will do the trick, as I like working with the Ring folk.

  First doorbell would drop WiFi constantly. Spoke with Ring who tried to blame it on everything but a faulty doorbell.

The replacement’s microphone didn’t work. They could hear us but we could not hear them.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Ring does not work with existing mechanical doorbell,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2018","<span>
  While it says that the Ring takes only 15 min to install... it's extremely misleading. First, they don't tell you that you may need a new transformer if you have an older home. So you may need to install a higher voltage transformer so it can handle the streaming video. Transformer is about $30. Then, the worst part is after switching the transformer and installing your Ring, you find out that your existing mechanical doorbell may not ring every time someone rings the bell. Why? They make it sound so simple. You call customer service or read blogs for this issue and you find out that its an issue with the Ring getting overheated? What??!! This is the most expensive doorbell on the market and you're telling me it can overheat? Ring needs to fix this or let people know of these issues and find a work around! I've spent hours with customer service and in installation to sort this out and now while the Ring works and alerts my phone... if my phone is not near me, I have no idea if someone is at the door because the chime does not work inside my house. So extremely frustrating! If the company knows that their product does not work well with a existing mechanical bell, then please include in your package the Ring Chime or something. This is just so misleading for consumers! And, its expensive to keep buying ad-ons.

  I've been using the ring pro for a couple of years now and I have come to the conclusion that there needs to be a better option.

  This system is an excellent way to monitor activity around the entrance to your house, which unfortunately has become an important part of life.  I had an ancient door bell system which the Ring system was able to accommodate just fine.  The system took only a few hours to install and get everything working.  The Ring customer service was excellent at helping with the one problem that I encountered.  The use of two Chime plugins allowed me to have the doorbell and motion notices delivered to additional areas of my house and even a remote area of my workshop was able to receive these notices via the Chime Pro.  I have been very pleased with the system.

  The Ring Pro is a wonderful product. It’s easy to install and just works. The only issue I have is I’ve notice over the last year a degradation of their service connection. Their servers have taken a large hit due to the number of Ring users and now there is a large delay. When someone rings the doorbell, it take over two seconds now for my bell to ring as opposed to almost immediately when I first got it a year ago. Also when I answer the “ring” on my phone, there is a large delay in “live” viewing; about a 3-5 second delay.

By the time I get a 'motion at front door' alert, and open the app, the person is gone. IF you buy the $30 annual subscription you can see what was there, after the video loads to the server. 1-2 minutes after the event. Alerts on shadows from trees in sensitivity zone. Does catch deer and cats &amp; dogs etc so it is fun to watch the saved videos, but don't expect real time functionality.

  I was a little skeptical at first based on some of the old reviews, but once I got the installation handled the device has been great. The installation wasn't as easy as I had hoped. I wasn't getting enough power to the unit so it wouldn't connect. I called customer support and they were really helpful and friendly. They were going to send out some pieces to work around the power issue. Unfortunately I was leaving town and wanted it up and running more quickly. After a little research, I purchased a new transformer. Once that was installed the unit had enough power to update and function properly. That was several months ago and I haven't had any issues since then. I've recommend it to a number of family members and friends.

  Daytime images are clear as if you're looking at it in person with your own eyes.  However, Ring still has issues with night vision being unclear.  Neighbor had a hit and run with his truck parked in the street and if had beenhappened in the daytime, I have no doubt that it would have been clearly witnessed by my Ring.  however, because it was at night, it was as if a ghost did the action.  No image of the vehicle, or the crash, but the police lights clearly show up after they're called to the scene.

  Not bad.  Really can’t read a license plate from our door to the street of 50 feet.  Plus the algorithms that Amazon uses are sub par.  They really can’t for example take out when a cloud goes by and creates different lighting on the ring or if it is windy and the bushes rattle.  For such a huge company would think their programming/algorithms would be much much better.  But still works... just takes like 2 minutes to save to the cloud and view history.  But I would think in the future Smaxon should be able to greatly improve a so-so product.

  I love our Ring products. We’ve had them for five months now. They work well most of the time. The only downside has Ben when the whole house loses power. About half of the cameras wouldn’t reconnect including the doorbell and they had to be tinkered with to get them to reconnect. The doorbell’s cover had to be removed and the doorbell had to be reset. The other cameras had to be reset up as well. They all remembered the network and the network password so I do not know why they couldn’t reconnect without this effort.

  This device can be a little tricky to install, depending on your home's existing chime and wiring. However, Ring's support is top notch, and the device is worth the trouble. I now have two of these installed at my home, and am very happy with them. They provide a welcome sense of security to my home, and have been pretty reliable in the few weeks I've had them installed. Their Cloud Recording is fantastic, and worth every penny. I would like to see more API integration Partners, but that is a very minor gripe. The primary function of ""Caller ID for your front door"" is completely delivered, and I highly recommend this to all my friends.<br><br>Biggest pitfalls to be aware of:<br><br>Battery Operated Chimes are a non-starter. You'll need a new chime and Ring's is pretty cheap at $30. Just get that.<br>If you're getting a new transformer to power this, get a 24v. If you're getting more than one Ring Pro, get each it's own transformer.<br>Make sure your Wifi is rock solid at the place you're installing. This will only give you headaches if you don't check it first.

  Was relatively easy to install, and initial set up was also fairly easy.  It worked for about an hour, then suddenly stopped working.  After trying everything I could to get it back up, I called ring support and spoke with someone that said this is a known issue with the Pro, call Amazon &amp; get a new one.  I did that, and should have a new one in a couple weeks. So I got a dud.  How Ring can put out a product that can't connect to wifi correctly is simply incomprehensible. This is 2019, connecting something to wifi should be automatic and easy. The new one may work fine, but I'm not holding my breath, as this is apparently an uncommon problem.  Along with the ring pro, I received an Echo dot as part of a prime package deal.  It connected to wifi in less than a minute and has had no issues.  But somehow Ring's $250 camera can't manage the feat.  If anyone has a good explanation for how that's possible, I'd love to hear it.<br><br>UPDATE: I received my new pro a couple weeks after I got the first one.  Installation was again easy as I had everything already set up and knew what to do.  Had some initial trouble with possibly the internal battery, as it worked, then it stopped due to loss of power.  That corrected itself after half a day. But the main problem of not finding my wifi connection never came up.  It's been going strong for several weeks now with no issues. I love getting the alerts when someone walks up to our door or when my kids come home from school.  The neighborhood information I get has also been great (and a little eye opening).  I worked with Jason from Ring during this entire process and he couldn't have been more helpful in making sure the issues with the first Pro were resolved.

If your placing towards an inside corner then part of the video image will be of the wall, can probably be fixed using the angle kit. The video itself was ok, but not great.

  I had a pro install it, which of course made that part easy. Beyond that, my normal wifi signal was barely reaching the doorbell, which caused a lot of latency and intermittent live connections. I already had an eero extender system and so I set that up. The issue is that once the doorbell is on a network, it is very difficult to change (you need to open up the doorbell and press a reset button). Rather than doing that, I ordered the ring chime and wifi extender. That did not do a good job extending my home wifi but it is easy to change networks on the ring chime and wifi extender. Once I changed the ring extender to the eero network, I got the performance I was expecting. A long road to get where I thought I was going to be out of the box!!

  The first Ring Doorbell Pro I received didn't work. When I called customer support, they suggested I purchase a new transformer with a higher voltage. Fifteen dollars later I had the new transformer. After installing the transformer, the doorbell still didn't power on. I called customer support a second time and they said the unit must be defective and sent me a replacement. When I got the replacement, I installed it and it still didn't power on. Customer service wanted me to check the voltage going to the doorbell. Forty dollars later I had a voltage tester and confirmed there was correct voltage going to the doorbell and it still didn't power on. I called customer service again and they wanted me to replace the doorbell with a lower model. I had enough of trying to get this thing to work and just decided to return it.

  I love this thing. I originally bought it on a bit of a whim, but I'm extremely pleased with it. I would have gotten it from Amazon, but they weren't in stock yet, so I bought it from a local retailer.<br><br>Setup was fairly painless. Setting up the wiring for the extra power kit to my existing doorbell box inside was easy enough. Hooking up the unit to the two wires from my old doorbell was also very simple. Once the Ring powered up, I was able to get it on my wifi first try without any issues. I do have a 5GHz router that's basically directly above the doorbell on the second floor, so its connection is strong and quick.<br><br>The worst part for me by far was mounting it to the wall. I had to drill through solid brick. Ideally, the width between the holes on the back of the Ring would be the width of a standard household brick. If that were the case, you could drill both holes through mortar above and below a brick rather than straight through the brick itself. Unfortunately, the holes are too close together; drilling through solid brick sucks. The Ring comes with a masonry bit, but good luck using that to actually make a hole. I ended up borrowing an electric drill from a neighbor and used some smaller bits to get holes started. It was an exhausting 30-minute ordeal to get the first hole drilled. I was at least able to make the second hold through the mortar. This would be easier I'm sure if I had a hammer drill, but I just don't drill through my walls enough to need one sitting around.<br><br>My biggest gripe (and the main reason for dropping a star) is the same as most complaints - motion detection at night is just not good enough. Any change in lighting triggers a motion alert, so if a car's headlights hit it or if it's storming and lightning outside, you'll get an alert. I learned I could offset some of those false alerts by keeping my porch light on at night, but I still probably get a false alert about once every other night. If I didn't live at the end of a quiet cul de sac, I imagine I'd get a lot more than that.<br><br>Otherwise, as far as operation goes, it's been quite reliable for me. The video quality is good, although I wish the audio quality was a little better. I love the ability to silence the old doorbell inside my house if the kids are sleeping. Honestly, the whole idea of answering my door with my phone from anywhere and seeing and talking with someone on my porch is just awesome. I like that everything is recorded and that the cloud service is reasonably priced. The IFTTT integration works well - I have a rule setup to turn on some lights whenever motion is detected in the evenings. It would be nice if you could stream the video into some other integration like a SmartThings hub.<br><br>The web interface and Windows 10 desktop app are also a lot better than I expected. Through the web interface, you can actually generate a link to share any of your recordings, which could be pretty handy.<br><br>So in summary:<br><br>Pros:<br>Relatively small and unobtrusive, looks sleek<br>Motion and ring notifications work well, especially in daylight<br>Cloud recording service works well and is a good value<br>Nice web interface and Windows 10 desktop app.<br>Integration with IFTTT so you can have it trigger other things like turning on lights<br>Good customer service; simple support ticket system<br><br>Cons:<br>Hard to mount if you're dealing with brick<br>Motion detection is too sensitive at night, any light change (headlights, lightning, etc.) will trigger it<br>No way to adjust the camera within the unit<br>Sound quality could be better<br>No way to stream video to other IoT device such as a SmartThings hub

  I love this product.  The installation was straightforward and easy to follow.  The one problem I had was I have three inch siding and the Ring door bell is longer than that and, from my understanding, not able to attach it sideways.  I had to modify my installation by cutting out my siding building it up and framing it in.  This would not be a simple task for someone who does not have some basic construction skills.  I think there was a product which compensates for the siding variation someone could buy, so keep that in mind.  Aside from my siding issues, install was quick and easy.  I would recommend this product to any one even remotely thinking about getting one.  Audio is great, pictures are clear.

  We love the Ring Doorbell Pro.  We originally purchased the Ring Video doorbell (1st edition), because we had some neighborhood kids being mischievous and knocking on doors and hiding.  This helped us catch the kids and show proof to the parents of what they were doing.  We also love the fact that we can see our dog sitter come/go and who is at our house, either dropping off a package or at the front door.  The only issue we had with the 1st edition, was the fact that we had to charge it and as the clouds would burn off and the full sun would shine, the video looked like a complete washout of white.  Also, playing live video or answering the doorbell from the app was occasionally iffy...  I was told the Pro version had better visibility (1080) and would definitely help with the white washout and enhance the door bell app.  So far, a week later I agree.  The picture quality is literally like night and day.  I didn't like having to drill new holes in my hardi plank siding, but following the instructions on installation was easy and I had it done in approximately 10-15 minutes.

Only time will tell if the Ring Doorbell Pro is a good investment or a waste of money. 5 days of service  right out of the box is unacceptable.

  I love my Ring Pro.  I love the two-way communication, and the picture clarity-once it shows.  My biggest complaint is the delay.  I have the fastest cable internet available, but many times visitors would be in the house before it alerts me.  Another problem is when alerted of motion, if I immediately select the alert, it can’t open the live feed.  It is literally a couple minutes before I can see anything.  If there were a need, I would be too late.  Honestly it seemed to work better before I agreed to pay the monthly charge.

  The camera was fairly simple to install, all the tools required to installing to scenarios where you might need a longer wire and such were all provided and properly labeled. The setup took about 15 minutes or so. The quality on the video is pretty good, night vision is a bit blurry. Had to play around with the motion settings and create multiple zones to get just the right amount of coverage, the default motion is very wide and the alerts were going off non stop.

  The actual product arriving on our doorsteps was awesome. Very well packaged, brand-new out of the box. The physical instillation was somewhat easy. A tiny bit of work but nothing to cry home about.<br>  After getting it installed, the major problem is keeping it connected to our Wi-Fi. Most of the time it's somehow disconnected. At other times when it's working, it's awesome to be able to check whose at your front door and communicate with them. I don't want to send it back. I see all the other great review's on here. Tomorrow morning my wife and I have to reconnect it again to our Wi-Fi. We also have the extra door bell ring for upstairs, which had been an equal pain.<br><br> ******I don't have the heart to tell anyone NOT TO BUY IT, just be aware if there's problem maybe with your Wi-Fi, then it will carry over to this also.

  Purchased this door bell over the holiday and it came with a free echo dot. The ring doorbell is working great for us, with no problems to date. It has been installed at our home for about 1 week now. Day time and night time vision is clear and vivid. Audio is great as well. I researched most of the video doorbell products out there and decided to go with ring as overall it had  good reviews and the yearly cost for subscription to be able to save videos was low compared to some of the other options.<br><br>It was easy to install as well. At first we debated having an electrician install it at the same time they were installing fans, but we took a stab at it and it was very simple. My husband was able to do it within 30 minutes or so, we did have to use one of the wedge mounts so it sat better against the outside wall. There are 4 face plates to choose from so you can go with the one that looks best on the outside of your house.

  The product showed potential however installation directions were difficult and equipment was not compatible with existing home set-up.  Digital chime was not compatible, the existing doorbell power is insufficient to power the Ring Pro, and the return instructions weren't clear that the equipment return date had past and cannot be returned. I was still hopeful to be able to return but customer service was difficult to reach.  In short, I am stuck with a $200 equipment I can not use nor return.

   So glad we got these installed before Christmas. We caught this lady stealing a package off of our porch. Ring support is amazing. They helped us set these up in our old (with weird wiring) home. They sat on the phone with us while we installed it, looked at pictures of our wiring and walked us through the setup. One of the doorbells was defective and they had a replacement here in less than 48 hours... And, they actually contacted me when the package was stolen and asked if they could share my video on social media. We have two of these for our front and side door. We will be buying a Ring camera next.

  Purchased Ring Pro in Jul 2017 and had professionally installed.  It was ok, some things annoyed me initially - like, we would get a push alert and would try to open it immediately, but it would take so long to pull up the app, that the person or thing causing the sensor to trip would already be gone.  This means of course there was no way to actually talk to anyone when they would ring the bell.  I got over it.  Then, about a year after owning, it stopped allowing me to pull up the live view and record anything. App would just crash every time.  We pay for extra hi-speed internet btw, so I know that has nothing to do with it. Now, after just over 2 yrs, completely dead, won’t even turn on at all.  Do not recommend at all, will be looking at other brands.

  The doorbell works fine however, I'm not paying for the monthly service and it turns out to be a very expensive ordinary doorbell. Without paying the monthly fee, you won't move fast enough to see who's at the door. Nothing saves to the phone or Alexa. It's either on their cloud or not at all. Whenever I opened the app I would get an inescapable screen indicating I need to pay the monthly fee in order to view any videos.

  The installation was a little tougher than described, the lag between motion or doorbell ring and the video on our phone means it's not seamless, but the Ring has for sure provided a whole new level of awareness of activity around our home, and a higher sense of security.  We've added more Ring cameras around the house after we tested the doorbells. While we were away we were able to question someone looking in the garage windows what they were doing on our property -- that sure surprised him.  We also know for sure when packages have been delivered and by which service they're from.  It's also become a fun way to see the wild animals and birds around the house and monitor the dog when he's in our fenced yard.

  I've had the Ring for a couple of  months now. I had to upgrade my Wi-Fi and buy a Wi-Fi booster in order to get the Ring to work for me. The Ring records and notifies me correctly but you need a good Wi-Fi signal for it to really work well. I wasn't aware of that when I purchased it which was my fault for not doing my due diligence prior to purchase. The directions/support people say you need at least 2 mg upload but it really takes more than that. My router is within about 20 feet of the Ring but I still needed more speed. The support community is great, extremely helpful. I've had several conversations with them and each person has been personable and genuinely helpful and patient!

  Great product, it does everything a video doorbell security device should do, but Ring did not do adequate development and quality testing of their Android app to provision in new devices when you install them.

  First, it took me a long a couple of months of planning to install this doorbell. The old classic round doorbell is installed in mortar surrounded by large uneven, protruding stones. This brought challenges to the installation. Trying to drill mostly into the mortar (and finding out there was stone behind the mortar), the holes were at different depths and had different rock protrusions to contend with to install a Corner Kit and Doorbell Pro. Using one of the Corner Kit provided small screws for the top and a long screw for the bottom, small washers to get in between gaps in the stone, and larger washers after to make a level mounting surface I was finally able to install the Corner Kit and the Doorbell Pro (I included a before and after shot).  The rest of the installation was as the video UNTIL..<br><br>The Ring Doorbell Pro worked the first night and would not work after. So I unscrewed the Doorbell of the Corner Kit and saw there was no Voltage (Use a MultiMeter when you install this for safety and troubleshooting) and proceeded to work my way back to the Mechanical Doorbell and then the 16V Transformer in my Garage, and found no Voltage all along the way. I was pretty sure it was the Transformer and I also remembered that the House Number Lights were also powered off the Transformer too. So I decided to get a 24V Transformer thinking there was not enough power to the Doorbell Pro.<br><br>Now everything works and I am mostly impressed with the execution and implementation of the Doorbell. I like being able to set different zones and the Doorbell Pro seems accurately responsive to the sensitivity and zones that I set.<br><br>However, there are three areas that I think things can improve:<br>1) Connecting to the camera once there is a motion or if someone pushes the doorbell can be a little laggy. I see the camera footage afterwards and can determine what triggered the motion, but in real time there seems to be a lag connecting to the Doorbell  Pro.<br>2) Today it seems you can schedule when Motion Detection is active - So if you are sleeping you can schedule not to activate during this time. I would like Ring to develop (if possible) when certain zones are active. My cars are parked in the street and I am thinking that disabling that zone during the day would make sense as people are walking there all the time.<br>3) Indicate what zone has been triggered in the Notification. Right now the app just tells you what device was triggered, but I think having the zone as well as the device in the notification will give you a better sense of what is happening. You can schedule when Motion is active, but this feature seems to be for the entire device and not per Zone.<br><br>Hope this helps!

I fooled with it for hours before buying an identical one from Home Depot, which immediately worked perfectly out of the box. So I had to return my Amazon one. Installation wasn’t too hard, but the size of the doorbell is about the same size (height) of a Hardyplank, meaning I had to notch out a bit of the bottom of the plank above the one I installed this on in order for it to fit nicely. Camera (day and night) work great, as does the motion detection feature.  Definitely would recommend, and will probably expand my Ring deployment.

I attempted to reboot, but can't get the screw out to remove the cover, so that doesn't help.<br>When I gave Ring a mediocre review, they sent me an email asking for more information which I gave them.  They were going to assign someone to the case, but that was 3 days ago and I haven't heard anything.  So much for caring about your customers.

   I love my ring video doorbell.  I purchased it back in 12/2017 but did not get around to installing it until 3/2018.  Was fairly easy to install, I did need to contact Ring for help at one point because after following all of the steps it still wasn’t working.  They walked me through some more steps with no luck.  I was then told to contact Amazon to return it for a new device.  When I attempted to return the device, it was already past the return date through Amazon.  So I contacted Ring again, told them the situation, and they said no problem and sent me a new device directly.  Installation of the new device went smooth and it worked great.  I did need to increase the speed of my internet connection though.  It was working but you could tell it was lagging some.  But after all of that, the Ring device works great and I am extremely happy with my purchase.

  Installed using a good transformer and simple chime. Set-up was straightforward but the door chime stayed on after the button was pressed.

So the most simple component is apparently bad. Terrible quality control. Why not test these before shipping them?

  I've read a lot about the Ring and the issue with the first part of the video being cut off. I assumed, incorrectly, that this was no longer a problem. When the bell rings it takes the app several seconds to open and then another 10 seconds or so to get the video started. After that I still don't see the live picture for several more seconds. The Video recordings all show the same problem, a still image taken when the motion triggered and after several seconds you what's there at that time. If someone was fast they could take a package and be gone before this started working. It's a lot of money for what is turning out to be a useless tool.

  Barely a month after I bought and installed mine, Ring updated their iOS app to remove a key feature that I had been using regularly: saving videos to my photo library on my iPhone.  Worse yet, the app still requested access to my photo library.  Even worse, there was no communication about this change - not a ""Heads up, we're reducing the functionality of your expensive device and monthly subscription service."" beforehand, not a note of apology after, and not even a mention of this in the iOS App Store update notes.  Looks like I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews before I purchased.

  This is a great device! I was hesitent about setting this up on my own but I didn't get electrocuted and I didn't burn the house down and it does work. Note: I live in an old house and the existing doorbell is kinda low. Once I installed it you can only see people approaching as when they are standing near it their faces aren't viewable. So if you have a low doorbell like me, you might want to have it professionally installed so they can raise it to chest/neck level on a normal sized person (so you can see their faces while talking to them). Also, get your screen door fixed if it swings open in the wind, this thing will litteraly never stop recording and sending off notifications.

  The Ring Video Doorbell is an excellent device that adds both security and convenience to our lives.  It provides an easy way to know when when some is at the front door - whether we are away or at home.  When paired with Amazon's Alexa, you can receive a verbal announcement when either motion is detected or someone rings the doorbell, and the Ring App lets you jump on and see whoever is there.  You can even limit motion detection to specific regions in the camera's field of view - eliminating spurious alerts which still letting you be vigilant about who comes on to you property. While not difficult to set up, it does require some basic technical skills to get everything dialed in.  That said, the end result is definitely worth it.  I strongly recommend the Ring Video Doorbell and plan to add additional Ring devices for other areas of our house.

  I researched several video doorbells and found the Ring Doorbell Pro and Nest Hello to be very comparable.  I settled on the Ring after comparing all of the features and price.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was easy and took about 10 minutes.  The app is very simple to use and adjustments to monitoring are intuitive.  It has been very responsive when home and when on Wifi or 4G away from home.  I can always see what's going on at home with this device.  I even use it to confirm weather conditions from time to time.  It has been a great addition to my home security system and I will likely be adding more Ring devices in the future.<br><br>My biggest question was how responsive it would be.  However, the doorbell picks up motion of delivery persons well before they ring the doorbell.  The notifications occur within about 2 seconds, so it works very well to see who is at the door and for having a live conversation with them.  Worth the price, especially if you find it on sale.  Recording service is also one of the cheapest on the market.  Overall, very good value for the money.

  I installed my Ring about a week ago. Since it is the Pro model you have to install a kit on your chime. The install is quite easy and they give you everything you need including a drill bit, and a reversible screwdriver. I did need to call support to get linked up, when I missed a key step in set up, so I can say that support was very helpful and had me running in a few minutes. I don't have an Android nor an iPhone, but Windows Phone supports the app. I bought the Ring because my hard wired ADT cameras and my wireless Netgear Arlo's are not the type with 2 way audio. I have the SW running on a Microsoft Lumia 950 with Windows Mobile and a Desktop and Surface Pro 2 both running Win 10 Anniversary Edition. Each alerts me if someone is at the door. I agree with another poster that it would be great if you could manually adjust the camera without tilting the whole assembly, but you can create zones to make part of the viewed area less sensitive than another. The standard model has a wider field of view but the Pro model can run in 5 GHz mode as well as 2.5 GHz. You get 30 days of free recorded monitoring, and it costs $30 a year after that, but if you don't want to record, the bell functions without using that paid option.

I shared her device so I could monitor it's performance while away.  I do not have access to her ring account.  I noted that that the night vision was no longer working.  When I had time I reviewed all of the night time videos to determine when it failed.  It failed on 22 Jul in a spectacular fashion.  Apparently the night vision is very sensitive to rapid exposure to bright light which caused it to fail.  I am again out of town.  Since I am outside the 30 day return window I attempted to contact support.  First by chat, but the system would not allow me to upload the video for some reason, even though it met the size requirement so they could not help.  I then called the voice help line and was told if I did not have access to the device or that they could not access the device then they would not start the return process.  SO now I have a $250 device that cannot perform one of it core functions, and cannot return it because the support staff must follow their script and will not deviate.

Our Ring Pro falls off the network about 1-2 times a month and has to be rebooted by flipping the circuit breaker it's hooked up to.  The doorbell circuit's voltage is between the needed 16-24.  I'm at 18-20 which is on the low side but it's still supposed to work according to tech support.  No fix for this except to replace my doorbell system's transistor.  Of course, right?<br><br>The newest problem is that it's December in Nebraska (not Canada mind you) and our Pro (not the regular Ring that we have on another door) has stopped working.  It's on, but it refuses to connect to the wifi.  Research shows that the coldest it is supported to operate is -5F.  This morning it is -13.  This is pretty normal for our area and much of the northern US, especially at night (when you need this doorbell most!).  So I'm SOL for 20% - 40% of the winter??  I wouldn't recommend the Ring Pro unless you have a house with new wiring (we have an older house) and you live in the South.

  Had never really given much thought to owning a video doorbell aside from the cool, Jetsons-like factor. However, a recent rash of package thefts from my neighborhood, along with some Prime Day pricing, was enough to move the needle from a ""nice to have"" to a ""must buy"" for me.<br><br>I spent a lot of time reading the instruction manual and watching the extremely helpful videos prior to attempting the install so there would be no surprises. Overall the installation was very simple and straightforward. Probably the most time-consuming part was figuring out which circuit breaker was associated with the doorbell (That breaker switch is now clearly labeled. You're welcome, next homeowner).  The unit connected easily with my Wi-Fi network as well.<br><br>Setup in the Ring app is easy and intuitive. At first, I was all gung-ho about getting ring alerts and motion alerts, but quickly silenced most of those. Adjusting the field of view for the motion alerts as well as changing the sensitivity to focus more on people vs. everything else is highly recommended. When my son is mowing the lawn, I also put the motion alerts on snooze otherwise it goes off with every pass.<br><br>So far we are very pleased with the Ring Video Doorbell. Luckily we have not had any criminal activity to report, although a neighbor (with a Ring) did capture some great night-vision shots of two men peeking in their front door in the middle of the night which they passed on to the police. We enjoy checking out the ""Live View"" of our front yard when not at home, and also get an occasional laugh from the HD fish-eye lens.  I would definitely recommend.

  The device has a very small battery in it which is charged by the doorbell transformer.  These go bad after time or depending on exposure to low or high temperatures.  Mine lasted about 1.5 years and now no longer functions properly.  It shuts down and goes off the network after you press the button to ring the doorbell.  There is a setting in the app to no longer ring your mechanical door bell and that appears to permit it to continue to function in a crippled manner for a while but you also have to have one of their ring chimes installed to hear if someone is at your door.  I would not invest in the products as there seems to have little truth in advertising and a planned obsolescence. Costs too much for a system which won’t last.

Easy to install, easy to use, ease and peace of mind. I can check from my phone at any time to make sure my home is safe! I haven't experienced any problems with connectivity or use.<br><br>I love the chime because I can change it (drives the pets nuts because they've figured out what it is) so now it's a game!

  I like this Ring doorbell pro better than my professionally installed five other cameras around my property in terms of convenience and simplicity to use. The pro doorbell also looks very neat when installed. One wish I have for future development is a user-selectable function that can automatically display a live view on my phone when a motion is detected or someone rings doorbell. It gives notification when a motion is detected, but you need to open the Ring app manually to view the scene.

  It wasn't easy installing the doorbell. In fact I had to call and speak to customer support on 4 different occasions to help me with the doorbell: when I first received the doorbell; then when I received the Ring Chime Pro that the first customer support person sent to me (for free) because it looked to him like my wifi signal wasn't strong enough without it; third time when I received the replacement  Chime Pro because I couldn't get the first one to install properly; and lastly when I received a replacement doorbell, to finally complete the installation/setup process. (The third customer support person helped me locate the doorbell transformer in my heater room, a transformer that turned out to be insufficiently powerful enough to support the Pro doorbell, and which had to be replaced by me. He speculated that the use of the improper transformer likely damaged the original doorbell; but rather than telling me that I'd have to pay for a new doorbell, he sent me out the replacement for free.)<br><br>I'm not laying out my travels through the installation process to talk anyone out of buying the doorbell. Instead, I want potential customers to know how helpful each of the customer support people were. (I do suggest that anyone buying the doorbell first should locate the transformer. Being told that it is often in the heater room in the basement all I needed to find it.)<br><br>BTW. Since I received and installed the replacement doorbell about 4 weeks ago it has worked just fine, as does the Chime Pro. I'm very happy with the video quality and the camera coverage of my front porch.

  This product is way overpriced.  Capturing a video of someone walking up to your door works OK sometimes at best.  Live streaming video is where this thing really sucks.  As soon as anything comes into its field of view it goes from a video to a pixelated still picture. Then if you exit and try to get back to video sometimes it will work correctly until once again something comes unto view but most of the time it doesn't reconnect. Especially with an android device. Same problem with a PC but not as bad.  IPhone or iPad I'm not too sure of.  I have another cheap video surveillance system which costs less than half the price of this Ring Pro but live video although grainy works when you want or need it to.

  Third one is charm!  I ordered this as a Christmas present for my mom.  She was so excited to get it. BUT ... the thing would never power on.  Spent over an hour on the phone with the Ring people.  She told us it might take a day or 2 to power on. After 4 days still no power.  Sent this back and got a replacement.  Again, it would not power on.  Waited a couple of days - nothing.  Talked to the Ring people again, and he said some of the Amazon stock had problems.  He was sending us one from their stock.  We left the 2nd one hooked up willing it to work, and when we went to install the 3rd one, the 2nd one had powered on - after 1 whole week.  Set it up but it didn't work properly.  Installed the 1 we got from Ring directly.  Guess what?  It powered on immediately, was easy to set up and works perfectly.  I love the Ring Pro doorbell, but the whole process was such a hassle.

  I chose to go with the Pro version for the smaller size and better camera.  I did have to relocate the door bell so Ring Pro could face away from the front door, but I knew that was an issue before purchasing.  It is very useful to know who is at the door and when we are not home who stopped by.<br><br>The only cons about Ring Pro is that the speaker on the unit is not loud or clear enough for some people to hear us.  I also wish there were ways to adjust where the camera points instead of just installing the device crooked.  They sell white plastic brackets, but that doesn't look nice against our bricks.

  Promising looking product, but no luck. House is thirty years old, so not surprisingly, had to replace doorbell transformer and mechanical ringer with new units that are powerful enough and compatible according to Ring info. First set of electricians failed. Ring was kind enough to send replacement power block that goes in wall ringer (in case had gotten fried) and a free Ring wireless ringer. Second set of electricians, who had prior experience with the Ring Pro, were unable to get it to work. Still reported low power, was either ringing the wall ringer endlessly or not at all (though was ringing on iPhone and iPad). Might possibly have worked after letting it charge the power block for a longer time, but electricians cost. Probably would have worked if had opted to bypass the new traditional wall digital ringer and instead use the Ring wireless ringer unit (plugs into AC wall socket), but weren't prepared to give up use of regular wall ringer.

  I installed this about three weeks ago and have been very happy with it. Install and setup was simple. All of the problems I read about from the early adopters seem to have been taken care of (running version 1.3.91 currently).  I have my motion detection settings one tick away from the people-only end of the slider and have not had any false alarms.  When I watch the video from motion detection or doorbell presses, it always starts from before the person approaches the porch.  The only change I would make to the product would be to add an option to capture the video locally on my PC which is on the same network. I don't like the idea of having to pay $30/year for this, but I definitely will as it is not nearly as useful or valuable of a product without having the video captured for later viewing.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Ring Pro - exceed our expectations - and I was skeptical,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2016","<span>
  I originally was thinking about the original Ring doorbell,  but was incredibly happy to learn of the Pro version. It is much smaller in dimensions and was excited about the video quality (1080p I think). Installation was fairly easy - I did need to install an included adaptor inside by normal door bell chime box. It was nice because all the tools and directions are included. But more on that in a minute. It has been easily 4 months since we installed the Ring Pro and I am a solid user and believer in it. I have a fairly large family and have kids and delivery drivers coming to and from the house on an hourly basis. The Ring Pro has been awesome at giving me a heads up (via a cool ""wind chime"" sound) via my iPhone as well as the external Ring speakers we bought. That is nice - except when it is in the early early morning when the newspaper guy sometimes trips the motion on the Ring Pro - that scares us sometimes. I am sure that is configurable to make it stop - but I like the 24/7 notifications. When someone rings the Ring Pro (aka the doorbell) we get alerts on our iPhones - it is so easy to automatically launch the app, see who it is and talk to them in real time. The video quality is good, sometimes great. It is totally dependent on your wifi connection and proximity to the router/access point.<br><br>I have had a sporadic issue with the Ring Pro losing connection with the wifi in my house. I've learned that when this happens, maybe every 4-5 weeks, I just need to hit the side button on the Ring Pro, it goes into setup mode, and then hit it again and it will find the wifi signal again. Boom - fixed. I hope that this becomes less of an issue as the engineers at Ring continue to evolve the product.<br><br>One thing I'd like to mention is that you can monitor the outside live at anytime via the app by just clicking ""live view."" We love that - nice to check in when I am at work or I hear a strange sound at night. The night vision is very good for such a small unit - I've had no issues with seeing quite far and panoramically in night vision mode.<br><br>Finally, while we've lived with just relying on the existing standard doorbell chime in the house - we have since bought two of the remote Ring Chime speakers (both wireless) to install upstairs and downstairs. We prefer these as they plug into your electrical outlets and allow you to hear the doorbell (Ring Pro) anywhere in the house - love this - wouldn't go back. I recommend.<br><br>Listen, it is an expensive purchase for many. I had that moment where I had to consider how much I was spending on a doorbell. But it is well worth it, something I can't imagine not having now. Many neighbors have since bought and installed the Ring Pro once they saw ours. I look forward to great things with this company and hope they continue to innovate.

  We are happy with the ability to see who's at the door and speak with them whether we are at home or not.  The video quality is good, and the speaker on the doorbell is good enough that a person on the porch can hear us well.  I'm not quite as pleased with the audio that comes through the Ring to my phone.  It can be hard to make out what the person on the porch is saying.  We have added the Chime Pro WiFi Extender because our WiFi signal was weak, however this didn't improve audio as much as I'd hoped.  I consider the video and the ability to speak to the person at the door to be the most important features though I wish the microphone on the unit were better.  If it were,  I've have given 5 stars.

  The Ring doorbell is really quite nice.  The camera is great, picture is very clear and even in the dark is quite good.  The only real complaint about the system is that they really don't tell you that you have to subscribe to their service in order to have the camera be visible outside your house (and possibly in your house) after your 30 day trial.  It becomes a very expensive inoperable piece of equipment with out it.  Overall, it is decent.  Expensive for what you get considering that you continue to pay for it.

  Great little door bell.  My choices were between the ring pro and skybell HD.  The skybell HD was much cheaper during black Friday sale and offer free cloud storage.  However it lacks true night vision (it's has bright LED to light up the area) that ring pro offer.  My main reason for choosing the ring pro is the superior motion detection.  I rarely get false positive.  You draw zones to detect motion, no need to reduce sensitivity.  Must have for anyone with a connected home.

  Easy install and works perfectly so far. If you have an old doorbell with lower voltage, it might be a problem as per some other reviewers. Mine shows very good voltage and good Wi-Fi signal and had no problems. Did have to use my Wi-Fi extender (I already had) to get it to work properly.  The only reason the product didn't get a 5 is that after you get it installed and operating they tell you that you have to pay $3/month (or $30/year) for them to store you incidents. You get a month's free trial and if you don't agree to pay after that all you get are real time alerts and no storage. Not a big deal in the scheme of things, but felt a little conned after paying over $200 for the unit.

  Defective unit on the first round and when Ring replaced the unit I changed my mind on how they do things at ring.

It did the trick.  Works , like a charm.  There is a delay when opening up to ""answer a ring"", but I believe that is prolly my service.

  This doorbell has been a bit of an ordeal. Biggest issue - WiFi. But there were other issues along the way. Ultimately NOW I would recommend it to a friend, but you'll need patience, tools and great WiFi!<br><br>We purchased this because our neighbor had the Ring Video Doorbell and had a good experience with it, and we wanted some video security for package theft. The first doorbell arrived in great packaging, and with instructions that made it look/sound really easy to install. Not so much.<br><br>Issue One: Wiring. Our outdoor siding is wood. First you have to take apart your doorbell chime indoors and connect a power extender. That took about 30 minutes. Then outside, after uninstalling the existing doorbell, you have to hardwire this doorbell to the house. This presented a problem because the wires weren't very long. RDP does give you wire extensions, which is great, but there's a lot of stuff that then needs to be tucked into the house to hide, and the hole in the wall isn't big enough. So that would require drilling and making a bigger hole (we ended up not using the wire extensions, but it's something to note).<br><br>Issue 2 &amp; 3: WiFi &amp; Ding-Dong doorbell chime. The biggest issue was getting the doorbell to connect to WiFi, but the actual ding-dong doorbell didn't work either. Our WiFi router was about 150ft away from the doorbell, but on the second floor (doorbell was on the first floor). I spent about an hour with RDP customer service to try to QA the doorbell as well as the App connectivity. The wireless strength wasn't strong enough to reach the doorbell. RDP CS did send us a wireless extender (Chime product) for free, so that was a good gesture. We waited about a week for that to arrive.<br><br>While waiting, the ding-dong of the doorbell decided to start working (we didn't change anything...apparently it just needed to warm up?), but the video never worked.<br><br>Issue 4: We got the Chime, and it's such an eyesore. It also cuts your home WiFi in half, and dedicated half the WiFi just to the doorbell. Doing that takes away from the rest of the devices in the house, so it was still counter-productive. We decided to just spring for the new Google WiFi 3-point Router system and rig up the whole house. Spent nearly two house on the phone with Google CS, but got everything set up. Google CS even helped us connect the Ring Doorbell, which was fantastic. Note: Apparently the Ring Doorbell PRO works with the Google WiFI system, but the normal Ring Doorbell does now. The Google WiFi setup is too advanced for the regular Ring Doorbell, so they're working on a patch. Thank goodness we bought the Pro...Anyway We put one of the routers near the front door, connected the Doorbell to it, and now it works!! YAY!!!!<br><br>Now that it works, the video quality is great - there's audio as well. I really like the push notifications from the app when there's movement, ability to customize movement zones, and have shared users. The Talk function also works well. The drag in this whole ordeal was the month it took to get everything to finally work - thankfully the customer service experience (Ring, Amazon and Google) were all great, which made a big difference.

There is even as small dual bit reversible screw driver.  The registration process was extremely slow and some windows were covered by my phone key board.  The app is not very intuitive and clunky.  My biggest complaint is the very poor graphic decisions made in the installation and online instructions and login.  Their choice of font size and color are awful tough on color bling people or any normal person who wants readable contrast between paper and print are out of luck.

  So far the Ring DoorBell Camera works just as advertised.  I did run into an issue but so far the customer service guys are on it and sending me a new unit.  My camera some how just went off line and can not come back online.  New unit should be arriving in the mail today.  But, since then I have been loving the camera.  There is a slight delay in the response time from when someone pushes the doorbell to when it rings the chime in the house and when it goes onto the app, but other than that, great product.

  I was extremely happy with how well this device performed. Setup was seamless. Alerts were ON POINT! I even got it connected to our Alexa environment and could easily see it via our Echo Show device. A week later, the unit just died and I cannot get it to respond to anything. I even swapped our perfectly fine 16v doorbell transformer for a brand new one made for this device. No go! The device just starts blinking white LED circle. No setup mode available. Tried everything as per tech support. Tried changing power, power cycling and even adding Pro Power pack to chime... NADA!!!. I give this One Star because it's worth less than my nice paper weight at this time. Now on my app it shows break-ins in our neighborhood every other day... and now my family and I feel completely vulnerable all of a sudden!!!

  We recently moved into a new house and installed the ring doorbell pro. Installation was a breeze, I watched the video on YouTube before starting. I removed the old doorbell, disconnected the two wires and reconnected them to the Ring doorbell pro. I did need to drill one new hole to mount the doorbell as the spacing was different than the existing doorbell, but the drill bit was included in the box. Once it was mounted, I then connected the little power pack to the doorbell wall unit. Again, just two wires to connect. The power pack is much smaller than shown on the video. Once it was all connected a simple series of steps is all that is needed to set up the app, connect to your doorbell and Wi-Fi and you are all ready to start receiving alerts when someone shows up to your door.<br>We have a 1 Gbps internet connection in our house, so even the WIFI is extremely fast. That said the video quality is amazing sharp, clear and without any lag. The audio quality is adequate but not amazing.  I was able to have conversations from my phone with people at my door without being there, but sometimes it is a little hard to clearly hear every word. I was able to quickly set an area for motion detection simply but dragging a shape around the area where I wanted the doorbell to alert me. Traffic on the street doesn’t set off my alerts.<br>We have been extremely happy with the Ring pro thus far. It quickly sends alerts to both my phone and my apple watch to notify me when movement is detected at our front door. Video quality is clear even at night. The Ring pro comes with a 30 day trial that stores all motion, and we will be keeping this feature for $30 a year. It’s nice to be able to go back and review the video files from your phone. Otherwise you only have access to the live feed.<br>Another feature I like is that the Ring doorbell automatically linked me with my community where other neighbors have posted videos of suspicious behavior from their Ring doorbells.<br>I would recommend the Ring doorbell pro to anyone. We love being able to see who is at the door before answering it, and being see and talk with people while we are away.

  This has been a very pleasant experience. It's a bit of investment up front, but so worth it. It was easy to set up and install the software on my phone. Now when someone even approaches the front door, I get a pleasant chime on my iPhone. I can see what is happening in real time, plus it takes a 30 second video for a record of what happened. With a motion range setting, I keep it within 5 feet of the door (180 degree sweep) and I don't get false signals. When the doorbell rings, it gets our attention even better. For example, we were in Colorado and we heard the ring on our phone from our Washington home. We could see the people and talk to them as if we were right there. So convenient. How much would you pay for peace of mind? This really gives us peace.

  Product overall is great.  I have a high traffic area in front of my house and could easily modify the recording to narrow in on my porch. The draw back is that is requires a subscription and the service doesn’t really offer any good features.

So we only use the recordings which could be done with a security camera without the hidden subscriptions.

  Pretty useless. It worked for the first week. Now the picture constantly freezes at key moments. The motion detection triggers it to start recording but it freezes up when the person is far off and then unfreezes by the time it's gone. If it's someone trying to break in you would just have to ask them to old still for 15-20 seconds so the picture can unfreeze (problem is you're going to have a tough time trying to connect to it to be able to speak to them. Just a second ago FedEx rang my doorbell and my phone couldn't connect so I couldn't ask him to leave the package. It's pretty typical that the only time you can't use the Live View is when someone rings the doorbell which, to me, is probably THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME FOR IT TO WORK. My router is literally on the other side of the wall, not more than a foot away. I'm beyond irritated right now. Glad I spent so much money to get something that does what my already existing doorbell did except not as well.

  It is one of those things you must have, you can answer your doorbell half way around the world or ask your neighbor to answer it for you and sign any package that is being delivered. You can watch and never answer, or talk to them like you were inside the house. I placed mine 5 feet away from where the original doorbell button is located (better field of view) so sometimes people miss it and go for the original one. I talked to Ring support (by the way excellent support) and currently there are no connectors to wire a second doorbell button. I did open the Ring and I was able to solder 2 small wires so mine works by pushing any of the buttons (pretty sure warranty is voided) but it works perfectly.

  The Ring Pro is awesome. My wife and I were skeptical at first. After just a few days, however, we realized how much of a security asset this is. Setup instructions were well thought out and customer service was very helpful. My advice would be to make sure you have a 24 Volt transformer on your doorbell. They say the minimum voltage is 16. My transformer  was 16 with 18.6 measured volts at the doorbell. This would not power it up. I switched the transformer to 24 volts and it has worked great since. My WiFi is not the best, but I have had no problems with signal loss and the video loads fast on my phone. I only wish I had  wires to a doorbell for the back door. I may have to try the battery version of the Ring2 doorbell.

After it rains, there are no spots in the images that are captured.  The live conversation has a little lag, but, is sufficient to talk to a person.

  Wanted to wait a few days to post a review. Have the Ring Pro and Chime installed for over a month now and works great. A few issues/questions during initial install which actually turned out to be a good thing because saw first hand how well Customer Support responds and address any issues. CS responded to my questions quickly, continually emailed updated information, maintained contact with me until problem was resolved, and contacted me at end to make sure all my issues were resolved. You dont get CS like that in today's world! As for the Ring Pro and Chime, (once initial issues corrected) they work flawlessly. The Pro is on the opposite end of the home from where my router is so I opted for the chime and placed it in between the two. Albeit that I do have very fast internet (100 up/down) which I'm sure helps, have never had a connectivity issue or delayed motion to ring at the door. Probably going to add a few stick up cams in near future. Very please with overall device operation!

  Love the product, with one flaw. You will need to upgrade your homes previously installed doorbell with a 16v 30vac transformer (link to follow). I had a terrible time figuring this out, but as with most things, if I had just called customer support at the  first sign if trouble I would have been given the info I needed, lol. So I located the original transformer in the gang box behind the doorbell ringer box mounted in my house, simply cut the power to the doorbell (throw the breaker for it) and then remove and replace with the upgrade. I purchased mine on Amazon for about $30.00 with shipping. I am not an electrician by any stretch , lol, but found the process easily managed by watching a quick YouTube video on swapping it out.  The link below is for the NuTone 16v-30vac transformer I purchased. Manufacturer compatibility I am unsure about but my doorbell was also by NuTone.

The app is decent and my wife and I both receive notifications with very little lag, but the app is missing some basic features like time-stamps displayed during video playback and user-activated day/night modes. The software is upgraded pretty often so I am confident it'll keep improving.  It feels very solid attached to the wood frame of my outer door (at an angle using a separate kit) and it's great to know the warranty covers theft.

  I really like the original Ring and thought to upgrade to the Pro. Pro looks more like a doorbell. I was not interested in any other feature besides looks.<br>It was a bit of an ordeal to get this set up, mainly because these devices are easily hosed. Do one thing wrong and the device gets stuck and can't be reset. I had no trouble with the original Ring. It took three devices to get the Pro set up.<br>1) The first pro died because I connected it to my doorbell hook-up but actually I only had 12 volts there, this device needs at least 16 volts. Ring said to upgrade my transformer, which was not that big of a deal, $15 at the hardware store. But after doing that, the Ring Pro still did not work and could not be reset. I held down the button for 30 seconds but this did not help.<br>2) I waited the two days to get a replacement from Amazon and then this one was fried in the first 5 seconds. I had eagerly attached the wires in the back and was pushing it into the wall. to fasten it. My mistake was that I did not realize that I had forgotten to turn the power back off. I was not that concerned about shock since it is low voltage. As I was pushing the wires in the hole to fasten it one of the wire fell off the back, and that cut off power just as the device was setting up - and it could not function after that. Again, resetting could not address this and I needed to get another replacement.<br>I did get another replacement and that set up fine. So far it is working well.<br>I would have given up earlier but I really like the look of the Pro and other than setup being a pain, these seem like great devices.<br>My suggestions:<br>1) test you voltage with a multimeter before installing - or at least check the voltage of your bell by looking at the transformer.<br>2) Be very careful to have the power off, everything set up well before restoring power so that this thing can set up with no trouble. it is very finicky to have EXACT directions followed.<br>Ring should improve the factory reset on these so that it actually works. Having to replace the devices in this cases seems ridiculous.

  Overall we like the Ring Video Pro. However, it is set to ring our mechanical doorbell as well as the cell phone app, and only does so sporadically.

You can have the Echo Show give you the view from the doorbell camera, but the Show cannot be set to produce a ring sound, and you cannot use it for two way communication.

  I love the idea of a smart doorbell, and settled on Ring due to the location of our previous doorbell (the doorbell was mounted in such a way that would not accommodate Skybell). I had to use a range extender to get Ring up and running, but this was not a big deal as I had one that wasn't being used. Overall, the set-up was fairly easy.<br><br>Now that I've had the device installed for over one week, I can say that I love the video quality, but the audio quality seems to be lacking - it's distorted and, as a result, very hard to hear. Occasionally Ring goes offline, and this is my biggest frustration. I am not sure if this is due to an issue with my range extender or with Ring itself. Regardless, I missed a package delivery today and got no notification, despite the motion settings being set so that Ring will pick up a school bus going by on the street in front of my house. I have not spent a sufficient amount of time troubleshooting this, but hope it's an easy fix.<br><br>All in all, I'm happy with my purchase. I just wish the audio quality were better and that I could resolve my issue with Ring going offline.

  Picture is crystal clear.  In the first day I had it installed I was able to say thanks to my mail man who I rarely get to see in person, give the gas company authorization to mark my property and keep an eye on an important package for my wife... all from my office 20 miles away.  Installation was simple with the included instructions (there's also YouTube videos) and contrary to my wife's beliefs I didn't burn the house down!  I also purchased the Ring Floodlight at the same time and will likely install other Ring products around the house as a standalone security system.

  Installed Ring per instructions, however it melted my chimes on the wall (The chimes/ding dong) was very old and had no name to see if it was compatible.  I than spent several hours researching and found I could connect the ring direct to the transformer and it would notify me thur the smartphone when it sensed motion or someone rang the doorbell, which is what I wanted in the first place.  The telephone help line was very usefully.  Customer service has been excellent. It has been working about 30 hours and it is performing well.  The most serious complaint I have is that the information is not readily available on their site; you really have to dig to get information.  It did take me almost 10 hours to resolve the problems and get installed and set up the app.  Instructions are not clear.  An example is when opening the app for the first time it asks for your email address and PASSWORD.  Which, what password, I have 126 different passwords.  What I figured out is they wanted me to create a new password for their site.  If they had said create password instead of email address and password; it would have gone smoother.<br>5/6/17  After several days and installation of the chime Pro Wifi extender, the motion sensor is still delayed to the point that you see more peoples back side than them approaching.  The instructions for installing the Ring Pro and Chime Pro Wifi are horrible.  They are no instruction on how to operate or set the various options within the program.  You are just suppose to know.  Lowered my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.  Buy only if you have a couple of days to do all the work arounds.<br><br>5/12/17 Have the Ring and Chime pro (Chime pro was not linked to the Ring - very convuluted- now it is) installed and it has been working as expected.

There is a glitch in the software where everything looks to be finished initializing but it’s not quite finished. I had video showing immediately after the install but an hour later, I couldn’t view it. Customer support was great and walked me through the setup again and explained the glitch.  Since then, it’s worked flawlessly.<br><br>My only other issue is that you can’t IP into the camera and use it with my home security setup.

  the physical installation was not hard. However, when loading the app and setting up the ring it did not connect right away. It took about 5 tries to finally get it connected to the wifi/internet. Once connected it appears to work well. the pictures are very clear and you can zoom in. I did have to turn off the motion alarm because it goes off too often.

  Works great!  Had to upgrade my WIFI to get enough signal, but the ring-app helped me diagnose the issue.  Seems to prefer iPhone over Android, but does work with either.  Love the ringing sound used to notify me of activity at my door.  Like being able to tune the area that is being watched for activity.

  Can not say enough about the Ring Doorbell Pro. Make sure you use a volt meter to check your existing wiring prior to purchase. If it’s within specs, you’re good to go.

  Great product and helps keep tabs on the goings on near my door. My advice though if you are handy or dont want to tackle a project make sure this version works with your current bell.

However while that was a minor added expense the new bell is way more pleasant and our dogs dont loose their minds when it chimes.

  So far this device works great. The doorbell video feature is very handy in a house like ours where the front door is on the lower level. It saves a trip down a flight of stairs to see who's at the door or you can tell people you know to just come in if the door is already unlocked. The motion sensor is a bit slow to turn on the camera if the doorbell button is not depressed but that might be more a function of the internet connection or the way I set up the sensor field (It's not enough to affect my rating). Installation was relatively easy assuming you are the slightest bit handy.<br><br>I also have the non-Pro model on another door that has no power (so it required the internal battery). It also works well but it's not quite as slick as the Pro (it's larger, no Live View mode (if unwired) and the camera is not as high resolution).  I had to install a $30 WiFi range extender for this doorbell to work properly. I would recommend either model but go with the Pro model if you have the 24v power available.

  The product does what it's advertised to do. A clear picture give a wide field of view. Timely alerts sent to your phone to verify individuals. My only regret is the requirement to power the device. I have an older home that has an older transformer installed. Not enough power to keep it alive after it starts transmit and upload streams to my router. Just picture your phones battery losing power searching for or staying connected via WiFi. Just make sure your transformer puts out enough voltage (16v I believe)to provide a constant steady source of power. Other wise, it a great device.

  My wife &amp; I share this acct so here is the review for the Ring spotlight Camera Battery. First the size is pretty good once it’s up there you tend to forget it’s there until the spotlight comes on when it’s dark, LED lifts really light up the driveway and into the street. It is very simple to put up and it’s sturdy when it’s up there our street is very much a wind tunnel, even in some good strong gusts there is no to minimal movement. The speaker works great very clear voices coming through. We like to mess with our dog when she sets off the motion it’s just funny watching her try to find us. The motion schedule is easy to use, the motion range sometimes can be tricky to configure but once you got it then your set. Video quality is fairly good but does lag quite a bit even after we increased our internet speed. The battery charging can be a bit tricky but that could be from it possibly not taking a full charge or leaving it on the charger too long after reaching full but within a month I’ve already had to recharge one of the batteries but that could also be from the constant motion sensors going off like I said until you get the configuration correct. I would recommend this spotlight camera to anyone we’ve already told our neighbors to invest in them. We also have the Ring doorbell Pro and we are pleased with that as well but again but there is a lag issue as well with the video after replying to a motion detection. Hopefully an update will come out to fix these minor issues. So if your looking for a security measure for your home invest in the Ring products like the doorbell and Spotlight Cam (battery or wired and solar if I’m not mistaken). I forgot to tell you the night vision is awesome it really picks up on things at night and the quality is very good for a camera, nothing like our NVG’s when I was in the Army, but still pretty freaking good. There ya go

  I wanted to get a camera in my font entrance for security purposes, and I thought I'd give Ring Pro a try.<br><br>Installation: The documentation and video made installing this product easy to understand. I went to Ring's web site and watched the installation tutorial.<br><br>Set up: Initially, this product worked fine for the first 2 hours, then it would randomly go off-line. I ran through the setup process again and it came back on line... for about 3 hours before going off line again. I did some more research and checked the following:<br><br>1. Is the door bell transformer at least 16v? Check.<br>2. Was the installation at the door bell chime box done correctly? Check<br>3. Was the Wi-Fi signal adequate? It was OK, but not very strong.<br><br>To resolve this issue, I needed to extend my network using a network extender. So I bought one and placed it at the closest power outlet to the doorbell and re-ran the setup process a 3rd time. Everything was back up and I had a strong Wi-Fi Signal.<br><br>Everything seemed to be ok for about 12 hours, but when I woke up in the morning, guess what?<br><br>I then resorted to calling Ring customer support and I worked with them on the phone to try to resolve any possible issues I may have with my unit. That took 2 hours on the phone. The new issue was the ring doorbell was not transmitting a wi-fi signal for me to complete the setup process. Ring suggested I physically disconnect the wires from the doorbell itself and wait about an hour before trying the setup process again. I was highly skeptical because the unit itself was defective. I did as they suggested and it did not work. The unit seems to be stuck in a permanent ""set-up"" mode, even after doing a hard reset several times and attempting to get the setup process started to no avail.<br><br>As a last resort, I called Ring customer support again and explained to them what the real issue was. They agreed with me and will be sending me a replacement doorbell within a week.<br><br>I really hope the replacement unit works, I spent almost the entire weekend trying to get this to work reliably.<br><br>I will say that Ring customer support was great (that what I gave this unit 2 starts instead of one).<br><br>I'll post a follow-up once I receive and install the replacement unit.

  After ~5 months of use the videos started freezing approximately 5 seconds in.  You know, right before they'd really be of any use to you?  After a lengthy call with customer service (more on this later) they shipped out a replacement.  I received the replacement today and it was DOA.  Endless spinning ""white ring of death"" and unresponsive.  After another lengthy series of phone calls, they're shipping me a third unit, which I can only assume will be completely issue free.<br><br>The customer service interaction is pretty frustrating with Ring.  The level 1 support techs aren't able to do much other than to read from a script, which I pretty much have memorized at this point.  And you can't get elevated until you appease the box-checking warlords.  I thought I was going to have a better experience today, after speaking with what seemed like a knowledgeable tech on my first call for only 5 minutes or so.  ""Probably defective,"" he said, ""but sometimes it can take the capacitor 30-60 minutes to charge after install.  Do you mind calling back then?  If it's still doing it, we'll get it replaced.""  Unfortunately, when I called back an hour later,  I got a new tech who didn't seem to have access to the notes from that call and wanted me to do everything short of rewire my house.  If I hadn't been able to take some readings and show that I was getting adequate voltage at the doorbell location, I might still be on the phone.<br><br>So, the Ring Video Doorbell Pro gets 1 star because Amazon says it has to.  It gets a second star because it's a pretty slick interface when it works.  And a third star because they continue to ship me replacements, albeit at the expense of my free time and darker hairs.

I did not want a doorbell cam that operated on a battery, nor did I want one where the battery charged by connected wires.  To me this means a potential failure with a battery at some point in my future.  This seemed like the perfect fit after seeing it worked off my existing doorbell power.<br><br>I live in a new home about 6 years old so all my wiring and technology is very new.  I hired an electrician to come install the doorbell for me for a reasonable price.  I wanted it professionally done.  The electrician arrived and made sure the electrical output measured what the product required or better.  I measured better than required so I installed.<br><br>The next day I found the doorbell power was mysteriously off. It seemed to have shut off overnight.  I read online how to reboot the device, and did so pretty easily.  The next day the same thing happened overnight.  Repeated the process.  I also called Ring support to ask what was going on, and they suspected the device was broken and asked me to have Amazon replace.  Amazon graciously did, and I swapped the device myself.  The next day, the device was off again, this time falling off sometime in the morning after I left work.  Ring claimed there must be some problem with my power or wiring, so I paid a second time for the electrician to come out and check.  $100 later electrician got on the phone with Ring and provided all the measurements that exceeded what was required.  My electrician also swapped out the chime power kit with the second one I received in case the first one was defective.<br><br>The power of my device continues to go off once daily, usually around 9 to 10 am like clockwork.  Ring recommended Amazon swap the device twice more, so all it was swapped out 4 times total.  Same issue with each one.  After several calls to Ring customer support, I was now told this is a known bug with the device and Ring is working on it.  I have been waiting a month for anything meaningful to happen and nothing has.  While the support people are very nice, they are not very tech savvy and I am yet to speak to any engineer with technical know how.<br><br>Ring doesn't seem to be very good at testing their software before release as evident by the issue above.

Good WiFi coverage and excellent configurable motion detection.  My wife likes the soothing wind-chime sound that my doorbell now makes when motion is detected at the door.<br><br>Only issue I had is that I didn't check my transformer in my existing doorbell before purchasing.  I was concerned because during the installation process I discovered my house doorbell transformer was only rated at a 10v secondary voltage.  RingPro installation specifies 16-24 volt, but requires a minimum of 3.9v at the RingPro device to operate.  Due to the close location of my chime transformer to the front door where the RingPro is located, the wire length was short enough so not much voltage drop resulting in 4.25v at the RingPro device. If your transformer secondary voltage is less than 16v,  I would recommend measuring voltage across the terminals of your doorbell button before purchasing to make sure that it's adequate before purchasing. Or you may need another chime kit containing a newer transformer or additional booster transformer.

  After installing my ""1st"" Doorbell Pro there were some problems with the audio (sounding like there was a lot of interferance) and getting a black screen (at times) when responding to  the motion detector.  Customer Service was EXCELLENT.  After some (over the phone) trouble shooting,  my service rep felt there was a problem with the installation and sent a new Doorbell Pro out.<br>Contacted them again to help with the 2nd installation (which normally is very easy to do on your own) so they could monitor it more closely as I was doing the steps.  Although I did also add a WiFi extender, so far all seems to be well.  To date, I have not yet had anyone come to my front door to really check out the video &amp; audio but while testing with customer service, everything seemed to check out perfectly with the speed of connection being a bit faster than my first device.  When the device works, as it should, it's a beautiful thing!!!

  Customer service is great! The first ring pro I got was dead right out of the box. I was quickly sent another one, which works! So far the only bad thing I have to say is not really ring's fault. When someone rings my doorbell or there is motion activity, there can be a problem with the live video if you are trying to view it when not connected to wi-fi. I have Verizon and even if I am in a good reception area, the live motion is not good.

  Where to begin?  If you will drill into brick, have a corded drill and your own masonry bit.  For the cost of this unit, they give you world's cheapest bit.  I followed the in box installation guide.  Then fired up the app, which proceeded to tell me not to put the power breaker back on, or risk damaging the unit.  The guide directs you to put it back on.  You use a connection plate with 2 unforgiving holes you are told to mark for screws.  You'll need a way to mark on brick.  The connection holes are just tight through holes, no 1/16"" adjustment, or any for that matter, for those that like it straight.  Cheap bit wanders, then the doorbell is crooked.  It does take it bit to fire up.  Don't despair.  The App appears to work.  Caught me making some comments.  Going to Home Depot for my back doorbell.

  I've been very pleased with the product. Until installing this doorbell, I had the competing August product. I originally selected that product, thinking that it would be good enough and waiting for the integration with Apple HomeKit would be worth it. Long story short, after having this almost a month, I decided that the marginal yet-to-be-realized benefit of HomeKit was not worth the hassles of false alarms and inferior contrast management. I returned the August product.<br><br>After fighting the installation due to a bad unit, I was able to install the Ring Doorbell Pro over the weekend. Installation had the additional step of the pro power kit, but that went up pretty quickly. Just needed to make sure that the wires and things wouldn't interfere with the function of the mechanical door bell. After powering up the unit, the rest of the setup went very smoothly and quickly. I liked the ability to select zones for motion. I didn't want street traffic to give me any more alarms.<br><br>The Ring Doorbell Pro manages the contrast and shadows far better than the August product. Having night vision is very nice feature that make this an even more interesting product.<br><br>Finally, although the contrast is better with the Ring Doorbell Pro, I'm not sure that the image quality itself is better than the August doorbell. Phone quality is great, but the web quality seems a little pixelated. Far from a deal breaker, but something I thought you might find interesting.<br><br>It's only been less than a week, but I can tell that this is a well-designed product.

  Installation and set up was pretty easy. The biggest problem we have with this is when someone approaches the door  many times they are gone before the video comes up and then you have to wait a few minutes before you can replay the whole thing to see what you missed. Sometimes I will go out to get the mail and will be all the way to the end of the driveway before I get an alert on my phone. Lately the camera freezes when I try to speak through the device. When you check the device health it doesn't indicate any problems. Ring support is pretty responsive but their solutions to this problem, which involves uninstalling their app and re-installing, have not worked.

  I have loved having my Ring Pro thus far! It is nice to be able to get notifications when somebody/something is at my front door when I'm not home. The ability to draw out where you want the camera to react to motion has been awesome. I have seen and heard complaints about the non-pro model having more issues with false positives on motion, but once you get this dialed in it has been great! The only gripe I could come up with is how it reacted to lightning as motion, or a neighbor pulling into their driveway and their headlights passing over my lawn as motion. Not something that I expect to be changed, just a minor annoyance. That, or when a moth flew on to the camera at 3 AM and woke us up. But I am very glad to have the cloud recording so when something like that does happen, I can quickly review it and see if I need to be worried or not.

It just took us a little longer. We found watching the video on the app was more to our liking for installation than the paper copy guide. At first we found that our WiFi signal was not strong enough for the Ring so we went to Xfinity and learned that our modem was way out of date. We got a new modem and then got our WiFi signal very strong (300+) and the device health has stayed at a moderate interference, which operates just fine. We've had a couple of hiccups here and there (needing to restart the Ring or reconnect it to the WiFi) but we certainly feel like we can't live without it and are already planning on getting our next piece: the Ring Floodlamp/camera/alarm.

  Easy to setup. Video is great. Night vision is good. I would like if you could adjust the angle of the camera. Straight doesn't always cut it. Also the motion sensors are awesome, but you can't turn them off that I have found. So if you are in the yard and you turn off alerts, it STILL records video when motion is detected. So you have to DELETE the motion areas you set. To delete the video, it is a single file delete. So if your working in the yard all day, you may have almost 100 videos from motion that you will need to delete 1 by 1....like I did.

  The installation of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro was so easy!  The hardest thing was turning off the power to the house before removing the old doorbell and then drilling two holes in the stucco for the new Ring.  The app works great and after tinkering with the motion zones/sensitivity I now only get notifications for people coming into our driveway, front yard and door.  The ability to see when a package is delivered is great. Then you can have a neighbor or friend pick it up or bring it in for you if you have package thieves in your town (that happened to us last Christmastime).  Overall well worth the investment.  Between this and the new wifi connected electronic lock on our door we are all set.

  Works well and software is a decent amount better than wyze, although would be nice to have the speed of the ""Rapid Ring"" app but the full functionality of the main ""Ring"" app. Also costs much more then the wyze indoor cam so maybe this is an apples to oranges comparison. Can't comment too much on wifi as the router is in the adjacent room, approx. 20 ft away and it works pretty well but I don't have anything to compare it to.

  Was incredibly easy to install- took maybe 15 minutes. Works perfectly. The resolution is incredible and you can zoom on the videos. I haven't used it to communicate to anyone at my door yet but in testing that also worked well. I would say the only negative is that whenever a truck or school bus passes my house the motion detector goes off but I can probably fix that by adjusting the sensitivity of motion detection and it really doesn't bother me anyway. This was well worth the cost for peace of mind as I have had packages stolen off my porch in the past.

  I had the doorbell 2 and was getting too many motion alerts because I have s street about 20 feet from my front door.  The app on the 2 is different than that on the pro, which allows for a finer tuning of the motion zones. I have had this doorbell for a few weeks and have had zero issues with it. Video quality is great, motion detection is great, and the one time I needed tech support, they were great also.<br>Update 09/30/2018.  I liked this so much I told my neighbors to get one.  When they are galavanting around the world they can answer the doorbell no matter where they are as long as they have internet access.  Setup was a breeze.

  Good product but takes some getting used to.  Even though the range can be adjusted it still picks up street traffic.  Funnily enough it also picked up a spider crawling over the sensor - so it definitely does its job.  Would be nice too if there was an indoor ringer just in case your phone isn't immediately handy.  Would at least give you the option of answering with the video display or without and would increase flexibility a little bit.

  We are updating our house to a Smart Home, we installed new doors and we complemented with the Ring Doorbell Pro. Upon installation we discovered that the unit was not pairing to the phone app. Contacted customer service by phone after a few minutes, a live English speaking representative was on line and helping me debug the problem, the first question was regarding the voltage coming out of the transformer (the Pro requires 16 to 24 volts to operate) my was 22 volts, after a few more questions, she said that a new unit would be sent to me. After a couple of days a FedEx package arrived with the unit, I installed the unit and bingo it started working as the product is described.<br>The video is real good giving us all the coverage needed and the motion detection is exactly what we wanted, the sensitivity needs a tweaking, specially with shadows from trees at sunrise.<br>The one feature we would like to see is the integration with a Z-wave Hub, we love this product.

Make sure you have a good WiFi connection as well. We ended up needed to buy a booster for our WiFi because the signal would drop from time to time, but ever since we did, the quality has been great! Day or night, we always have clear quality. You can also set the parameters of what you want it to pick up as well- people walking by, cars driving past, ect.

  I bought a Ring Pro doorbell a couple of years a go. Recently, it stopped working in that it would only be online for a few minutes and then would go offline and stop working. I called Ring, they ran through some troubleshooting over the phone, quickly determined that the issue was w/ the Ring device, and then sent me a new one. The new one was easier to install than the old, and it started working immediately. Before my old one broke, it was pretty easy to use. Sometimes there was a delay when you tried to pull it up on the app, but overall, it has worked well and provides a nice feeling of security. Plus, the $30/year is much more reasonable than what Nest and others charge (and I have other Nest products that I love). Overall, I have enjoyed the Ring Pro and would recommend it.

It also has a community alert system in it that collects volunteered data from neighbors all over town. There is a cloud plan (everyone has them), that is reasonable and doesn't give me any trouble.

  I bought the Ring Pro in good faith and gave the purchase significant thought.  I watched the videos and was impressed.  Seemed like a good thing.<br><br>Then, when I started to install this product, I had trouble.  I contacted Ring's 24/7 support line (4 times) and was told the I needed a more robust transformer to resolve the problems.  So, I purchased a larger transformer and installed the same.  Still could not get a handshake between the transformer, Ring unit and my chime unit (Broan Model 305RW).  In my discussions with the tech folks at Ring, I informed them of the model and brand of my chime.  No one even suggested an incompatability problem with my unit.  I got no where with tech support, until I went to the Ring website and found a listing of compatable and incompatable chime/doorbells.  Obviously, I had an incompatable chime.  The Broan was not listed even though  my Broan 305 is the exact same as the Nutone 305 - which was listed as incompatable unbeknownst to the rep's I spoke to.<br>Furthermore, Broan bought Nutone - and the two chime units are identical except for the name plate.  If you list Nutone - why would the Broan not be listed as well as it is the same company?<br><br>Like everyone, I stay pretty busy and so it is upsetting that the advice I received caused me to rewire the product on multiple occasions, installed a different transformer, talked to tech(s) at Ring and further communicated through emails.  Yet NO ONE from ""tech support"" even mentioned an incompatability issue.  So, with the time spent trying to figure this out and going back and forth for what is a simple solution, I lost my ability to return the product through AMAZON and now have a new $250.00 Ring Pro sitting here with no purpose.  If Ring is going to boast about 24/7 tech support, at least they should have been able to provide a simple explanation of why this unit would not work.  Very disappointed with the lack of expertise and credibility on Ring's part.  At least now, I have a new paperweight (an expensive one at that). WTH???

  My old doorbell had stopped working so I was not sure how well Ring Pro would work. Turns out you can combine this with a Chime for a really nice setup.

  I personally love this device, I researched others but found that Ring had to be best viewing capability of all the others. Plus the reviews were good on the Ring Video Doorbell Pro since it gives you HD quality video and wider angle view. Honestly the price seems high but it is well worth it knowing the security of you family and who is on the other side of that door. With the rise of home invasion this is a good tool to prevent it before it happens or will allow the family some extra time to escape before they break in giving them time to call law enforcement.<br><br>Pros: Can view from anywhere you are at<br>  Get motion activity before someone rings bell or if they are in field of view (includes animals too)<br>  Backs up to cloud for viewing anywhere<br>  Solid constructions and easy to install and add to IoT house<br>  Works with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT triggers as well as Philips Hues systems for extra features<br>  Outstanding customer support and they all are here in the US (shocking I know) but very pleasant to work with.<br><br>Cons: Really the only thing I could downplay is it would be nice to store video and motion data local for internet connections like mine on Sat since it has to send to the cloud. This would reduce uploading off of Sat Internet which is poor to begin with.<br>  Needs to way to capture just a picture of a person in addition to doing a video of that person. Video nice but getting a good facial capture would be nice in future.<br><br>Other than those two not much I can say against this device. It is a great added extra security for a home since I live in a rural area we sometimes get people that wonder on our property so best to see them before they break in. I have not had to pleasure to check out other Ring products but I have read they compliment the doorbell very well.<br><br>UPDATE:  I have had this installed for several months now and can still say it is the outstanding. I have learned a lot over the last months but due to the excellent customer service they have I was able to find solutions to some of the issues I had. NOTE: THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT WORK WILL ON SAT NETWORKS BUT IT CAN WORK WITH SOME TWEAKING. The Ring Doorbell detects motion and uploads it to the internet for it to send to your phone. The same applies to when someone rings the bell so there is a slight delay when someone rings it. So far it has been nice since I travel and I have a good piece of mind that I can see when someone comes on to my property and or at my door. It also is great when family enters and exits the home so I know who is there. Yes, it has a high price tag but it  makes up for the feeling of security for my family.

I am not buying more equipment just to have this doorbell.  After being outside a while it got extremely hot to the touch.  Very frustrated with this product and it's on its way back!!

  Things can't go smoothly all the time, and the smoothest installation doesn't provide much installation.  I followed the instructions precisely, and the door bell refused to enter setup mode.  I got someone on the phone, and after checking a couple of things, he advised me to return it and get another unit.  I did that, and it was quite straight forward with a new unit.  Soon I was getting proximity alerts, neighborhood notices, and my Alexa Show could display a view of the front door.  It was so much fun I bought one for my daughter.

  The Ring Video Doorbell Pro was the perfect solution for me. I was looking for video coverage of my front door and my traditional doorbell was not working properly anyway. I am not very handy, but was able to install the Ring myself within about 15 minutes. Make sure you adjust your settings to only record during the times of the day when you are not using the door otherwise you may get overloaded with alerts. Once I figured that out, it has been smooth sailing. I would HIGHLY recommend this product.

  I would not purchase this product again. Tried installing it the week it was received and was unable to get the device to initiate. Called the service number on the box. The service representative was pleasant and patient but after an hour and 10mins of trying to resolve the issue I was told that we needed a special bypass wire which they would send me free of charge. Two weeks passed and no bypass wire. I called the company again and they thought that the holiday mail volume was to blame. One week later I received the bypass device. Once again we were unable to get the device to initiate and now we lost the sound to the doorbell. We were told by the company representative we need a new chime box so we went out and bought one. Guess what? Yup! You guessed it that didn’t work either. Now we were told that the wiring in the house wasn’t giving off enough electrical current to support the device. I wanted this to work so badly I went out and hired an electrician to upgrade the bell wire and transformer. Can you see where this is going? That didn’t work either. The unit is either defective or the product just SUCKS.  Now my window for return has closed and I’ve invested a whole lot of time &amp; money trying to get this to work.

  I installed the device and it worked for an hour. I called Ring support and spent 2 hours with them. I had to send pictures of the transformer, the inside doorbell and the wiring. I was told that I installed it correctly but the wiring gauge was to small and that I would need to rewire for the device to work or down grade to the Ring Doorbell 2. The house, as are all houses in the community, are wired using typical doorbell wire. I believe that the device simply failed and they refused to replace it. I'm not sure why a company would offer a device that would not work with normal doorbell used in almost every home. I returned the device and look for an alternative.

  5/18 update -Since I sorted out the electrical/power supply issues with the Ring doorbell, it was worked fine for 9+ months. Ring really needs to rethink the ""average install time"" claim for this product from 15 minutes to ""months"". Unless you direly need a doorbell cam, consider the hard wire or battery powered ""spotlight camera"" offered by Ring and take the 24v transformer wiring nightmare out of the mix. For that reason alone, the doorbell camera remains 2 1/2 stars for me leaning towards 3 stars.<br><br>8/11/17 update -  The  2nd replacement camera has performed flawlessly for nearly 3 weeks since I installed it. I'm changing the rating from 1 start to 3 stars because of a the current success. When these cameras work as designed, they are great and worth the money. When you get a bad unit, they will drive you nuts. If your Ring Pro works well, you can stop here. If you have tech issues, read on.<br><br>7/23/17 update - OK, the replacement Ring Pro camera  they sent to me WAS defective and the second replacement camera worked perfectly! I may move the rating to 2 or 3 stars eventually IF the second replacement Ring Pro actually continues to function properly.<br><br>Original Review:<br>I have 2 of these units, one has worked perfectly since December, 2016 with mediocre WIFI signal (RSSI  -67) and a Thomas &amp; Betts 24V AC transformer that would NOT work with the second camera. The other Ring Pro has been a complete nightmare until I got finally got a camera that worked and got it fixed. if you are having WIFI and/or power problems, settle in and read the saga below, . Sorry for the length of this review - it' been a 3+ month adventure.......<br><br>I bought a Ring Pro Camera from Amazon in December of 2016. It worked pretty well until about April of 2017 and then it started to disconnect and the image grew fuzzy like the camera was slightly out of focus. I contacted Ring and we went through all the testing and system checks multiple times and I grew weary of sending them the same data over and over. Finally, Ring agreed to send me a new camera in June of 2017. The new camera had a very sharp image but it went off line every day and had to be reset daily, more often than the original camera.<br><br>To be clear, I followed the Ring wiring directions when I set up the camera up in December of 2016 and used brand new, direct wire components (I didn’t wire it to a doorbell). I used the following new components:<br><br>-Thomas &amp; Betts 24vAC doorbell transformer that I changed to an Elk TRG2440 24V AC 40VA model - the ONLY transformer that worked!<br>-Thomas &amp; Betts 22 gauge wire for the 25 foot run from the transformer to the Ring Pro that I changed to 20 gauge wire to prevent voltage drop<br>-WAGO 221 lever wire connectors for the ""power pro"" which ii actually a simple 1 amp fusible link. BTW, the replacement fuses for the ""power pro"" are NOT anywhere on the Ring website but I finally coerced the replacement data from a level 2 support person - here is the link to those fuses -  https://www.amazon.com/Qty-Fast-Blow-Fuse-250v-GMA1A/dp/B004HLYLFI<br><br>The replacement camera they sent me in June of 2017 kept going offline so I contacted Ring and they sent me the Chime Pro 2.4G repeater and after weeks of screwing around with that device, it didn’t work and the camera was still going off line daily. (See my Chime Pro 1 star Amazon review for those details). In light of the data I’ll present below, the Chime Pro may not be a 1 star product but you decide after you read how this saga winds up.<br><br>When the replacement camera was going offline, it would only respond to being unplugged or with 15 second hard resets or both. When I was doing those hard resets, I noticed that the camera felt unusually warm. I used a direct read kitchen thermometer and the camera temperature was between 140 degree and 153 degrees – that seemed really hot to me. I searched the Ring website for overheating issues – none cited.<br><br>I Googled the problem and saw many reports from users who also experienced Ring Pro drop outs on a daily basis. I took the Ring camera down to make sure the wiring was intact and to my shock, the brand new composite Versatex trim where I had the Ring mounted had turned brown from the heat. (See attached photo). I sensed a potential fire hazard, disconnected the camera immediately and contacted Ring again and explained my problem. Here was there email reply to my inquiry they sent me on July 14, 2017:<br><br>“I'm so sorry for the inconvenience I would be frustrated also. It does appear that it is overheating and should be replaced. All of the information you provided seems to be the normal operation other than the unit is running at a very high temperature. Please complete the following asterisked (*) information so I can send out the replacement Ring Doorbell Pro to further assist you.”<br><br>OK, I guess I got a second defective camera from Ring. Within a few hours on the same day, I got another email from Ring:<br><br>“I'm sorry for all of this inconvenience and definitely understand your concerns with the discoloration. I was informed by my technical advisors that this is normal for the Versatex material and that the temperature of the device is operating normally. I am again sorry for any inconvenience or confusion.<br><br>I was both aggravated and angry. I had jumped through every Ring support request for WIFI signals at the camera, router, sent pictures of the wiring, the transformer and the setup to them and frankly, I was sick of Ring support and their sketchy products. There is NO data on the Ring website about any issues with composite trim or siding with their cameras and I challenge them to send me that data with proof of date prior to my issues. They won’t send the data because they can’t because they lied, made that nonsense up and threw me under the bus. Ring support has not replied to any of my email since they told me to basically hose off. I guess there is nothing they want to do about the camera that damaged my house and presented a potential fire hazard. Nice company.<br><br>The new camera never seemed to work right either and it disconnected even more often than the old one  - WTF? I tried another Thomas &amp; Betts transformer and replaced all the 6 month old wire using 20 gauge rather than 22 gauge (25 foot run). I added a Verizon approved and supplied network expander ($99 out of pocket) and the stupid camera kept disconnecting. It felt warm to me when I hit the reset button to reconnect so I checked the temperature and the new Ring Pro was anywhere from 163 degrees to 184 degrees depending on time of day. I took the camera down and it had gotten so hot that it caused the brand new Versatex composite trim on my house to turn brown and begin to melt and the wires left an impression in the trim. According to Versatex, their trim board begins to deform at 150+ degrees. I added the Ring supplied trim backer plate to see if getting some air behind the unit would cool it down - nope, it was still running well over 155 degrees. I'm worried about a potential fire hazard so I unhooked the camera and emailed Ring who got back to me quickly. Their service response is 5 stars but their product is 1 star.<br><br>Ring told me today that I have another defective Ring Pro and they would send me a new one. Geezus, what a pain in the neck. I have D Link and Vimtag cameras that are zero drama, work great with zero problems and this Ring brand is a push button disaster. See the photos below of the burnt trim and the camera with the backer plate. It's turned off now until the SECOND replacement arrives. Never been this annoyed by a product ever.<br><br>Ring never mentioned checking the unit temperature. A few weeks ago, they did recommend their Chime Pro ""extender"" but it only works on the 2.4Ghz network. If you have other cameras on the 2.4Ghz network, this could be an issue because it limits bandwidth for the Ring camera. The Chime Pro is a piece of junk - see my review of that unit under the 1 star ratings under the name ""Tretiak"".<br><br>So here I go again. Another Ring Pro on the way. Will it work or have connectivity issues or be a miniature slow cooker bolted onto my NEW composite trim (who's paying for that?). Until Ring improves their camera to match their service this is 1 star because from where I sit, it's an overpriced piece of junk. (the replacement camera did work).<br><br>I attached photos of the discolored Versatex trim that was caused by the Ring Pro. Ring denies this was the fault of their camera, and I say BS. Look at the photos and decide for yourself. If you mount the Ring to composite trim (Versatex or Azek) use the backer plate.If the camera gets really hot (140+ degrees) contact Ring and report the issue.<br><br>I'll update on my adventures after the new unit arrives and I get it set up. I'm not a 1 star an and a product really as to stink for me to low ball them like this but I don't see any other option until a get a camera that works and doesn't brand my house with it's mark.

  This is the second Ring product I purchased and my Floodlight Camera has worked fairly well.  The problem with the Doorbell Pro is that it is much more voltage-sensitive than they lead you to believe.  You can't just slap this thing on where your doorbell used to be, connect the wires, and be done.  Their customer service is very helpful but after both of their wiring kits, a new doorbell transformer, and finally their recommended plug-in transformer and new wire, the Doorbell Pro just would not consistently stay powered-up.  Short of completely rewiring the doorbell circuit, and I'm not even sure that would work!, the product just did not work.

The  other complaint I have is how long it takes for the app to notify you and open after the notification. Even if you were sitting by your phone,  someone can walk up and drop a package and be gone before you can see them on your screen.  You can go back and view it as long as you have the subscription  to the cloud.

  Never worked. On top of that, we called Ring to get a new unit, and they won’t ship out a new unit until the old, junk unit is returned. So on top of putting 2 hours into the install and 45 mins on the phone, I have to take it off the wall and put on my old doorbell, go to Staples amidst the coronavirus, wait for Ring to receive the unit, then wait for them to ship a new one to me (rather than shipping a new one and charging me for the old one if I don’t return).

This device solved that problem.<br><br>I actually had to install an old school chime because there was not one already there as well as a transformer ($13 - kit @ local hardware store).

  Easy to install. The 1080p HD Camera is as advertised - crystal clear high def video - and works well both in bright daylight and dark night. I immediately signed up for an Annual Ring Video Cloud Recording Plan and ordered a 2d Ring Video Doorbell Pro for a less used door.

While the Echo Show provides a nice video of the area around the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, it does not have two-way audio. The absence of two-way audio functionality was a keen disappointment.

Just last night a friend came by to pull the 'ol ding-dong ditch prank.. it was hilarious their reaction when I started talking to them before they could take off. My husband is so happy about the $250 bucks I spent on this bad-boy, that he has yet to mention the cost again.. the only thing he can say is how awesome our new doorbell is!

  I bought this door bell about a month ago. My son installed it immediately, taking about an hour. Instructions were easy to follow. The kit included everything he needed to install. Most time was needed to decide what angle I wanted it at ( coverage angle ).

  LOVE IT!  I purchased the Ring Doorbell Pro so I could safely see who is at the door and on our front porch.  It does that and much more. With the ability to set 3 different camera angles at the same time, I get a full view of the porch and sidewalk, as well as some of the yard. The camera is sensitive enough that it alerted me when our flag waved into the view, due to a windy day. I like that I can turn off the motion detection while we are mowing the grass or have an activity, so it doesn't continually send motion alerts. Another great feature is the ability to ""answer"" the door without opening the door, or even being at home! The only downside is that my grandson loves to make the motion detector activate by coming onto the porch repeatedly! I highly recommend this product!

  The product is excellent for seeing who it as your door and interacting with them.  It is very good at viewing your front yard and seeing what is going on - from anywhere.  It is not good for recording faces.  I had a delivery man deliver a package and upon reviewing the recorded footage --  I could not see his face at all. He moved so fast that Ring could not get a good recording of his face.  Also, nighttime viewing is not good at all - once again - you can see what is going on - but you cannot really make out who the person is.

  We have had comments about people casing our neighborhood in the late night hours.  The Ring gathers pictures of your area being monitored and it has been helpful in identifying individuals who were at our door with a time stamp.  We have been exchanging photos with others in our neighborhood, as well.  Extremely valuable.  The two-way voice capability is helpful to determine if an individual needs to be addressed.  Phone messages that notify me if there has been movement within the monitored area, also alerts me to investigate.  This is how we have been aware of packages that have been delivered so that we can retrieve them sooner than later.

  I previously had a SkyBell 2.0 doorbell which was a year long frustrating experience. SkyBell's mobile application is completely unstable and their cloud recordings work less than 5% of the time. I've been using a Ring Pro now for a few weeks and it has restored my faith in this emerging technology. Ring's mobile application is very responsive when answering rings, or quickly checking a motion trigger. The motion sensitivity and defined motion areas are great features. The Wifi Chimes are also great allowing the possibility of a doorbell ringing on every floor of your house or even in your garage. You can even change the tone of the rings which is fun. I am however disappointed with the quality of Ring's Cloud recordings which is a paid service. The image quality of the videos are great, but they often suffer lost frames, oddly the audio never skips, but the crucial video frames with a person's identifying features are typically skipped over and diminishes the value of this paid service.

  I had to right this review after reading a few about GOTCHA  COSTS.  Ring gives you a month of free service then you either pay monthly or yearly you choose. You can cancel it at anytime. The most you pay is $10 a month if you do yearly it’s less.  But the $10 is for unlimited cameras. If you have one doorbell it’s $3 a month. To me that was cheap and so worth it.  We love our doorbell and it works fabulous.  Also it gives me peace of mind.  We also have two cameras in the back of our house on our garage.

  Ring Product Review – Nov 7, 2016<br>Summary:<br>After three months of use of the Ring products, I highly recommend them as a practical and cheaper solution to home security than the more expensive systems available today.  I did have some issue with the products, but Ring customer support was more than helpful in successfully resolving my issues. When they could not help, they replaced or provided devices to me as stated in the review below.  The only real recommendation I have before purchase is to ensure the user is somewhat technical such as being able to find the WiFi router password, knowing where the Wifi setting are on their mobile devices, and knowing how to install apps to be used when installing the Ring App.<br>I’ve found the Ring devices to be responsive regardless of my location on the planet.  For example, I was on a long Australia trip where I had the same fast response to the Ring devices as compared to sitting in my home.  The Cloud service and the overall design of the solution is well done, thus there are typically not delays in any of the capabilities.<br>I highly recommend the Ring solution for any home.<br>Products Review and Used:<br>• Ring Pro App (IOS version)<br>• Ring Pro Video Doorbell wired, not battery<br>• Ring Stick up Camera<br>• Ring Solar panel  (to charge camera)<br>• Ring Chime<br>• TP-Link WA850 WiFi Extender<br>• Ring.com Customer Service<br>• Ring Cloud Storage<br>Ring Pro App (IOS version)<br> The Ring App (IOS version) is very well designed and easy to use.  Most setup options or configurations have been designed well and meet 99% of the user’s needs.  Ring has really thought of just about every possible configuration item you may need.<br> Recommendation:  Install the app before attempting to install any Ring device.<br>Ring Pro Video doorbell (wired):<br>The RingPro video doorbell was easy to install per the instructions, but I do recommend having an electrician on call as the instructions to have the RingPro work with your home doorbell may be difficult for some people. I installed the wired version that used the preexisting doorbell power supply.  This is the non-battery version, which I wanted as I didn’t want to watch the battery power.  The setup of the RingPro to my wireless was very easy and as the review will show, setup of all devices is exactly the same.<br>Recommend: Having the WiFi router password handy before starting.<br>Ring Stick up Camera:<br>The Stick up Camera installed very easy, much easier than the Ring Pro as there were no wires to connect or preinstalled doorbells to work with.  After fully charging the Camera (recommended as a battery device to be 100% charged), the installation as easy and complete in 5 minutes.  Setup of the device on my network was very similar to my RingPro and configured easy on my IOS app at the same time.  I installed two cameras and each time they installed just as easy.<br>Recommend: Charge the camera fully before installing.<br>Ring Solar Panel:<br>Since the Stickup Camera’s are battery operated, I highly recommend the Ring Solar panel to be installed in conjunction with the camera, otherwise you will have take the camera down every 3 to 6 months and charge it again.  Installation was easy and setup was simply plugging the cord into the camera.  The cord is extremely long that connects to the camera, which is good in some cases, but bad if they are mounted next to one another.<br>Recommend: obtain 3rd party (3M Products) to secure the wires to your home.  These do not come with the product.<br>Ring Improvement:  Provide plastic clips / accessories to connect the wire to the house or a way to shorten the cord that connects to the camera.<br>Ring Chime<br> The Ring Chime allows you to put the doorbell ringer anyplace in your home.  The setup is exactly the same as the RingPro and Stick up Camera.  Once connected, it appears in the app and is fully configurable.  Even the sounds can be changed so you no longer use a ‘ding”, but dog barking and other sounds.<br>Recommendation : I recommend buying at least one of these to put where you do not hear your manual doorbell, for example back yard, deck, or garage.<br>Installation TP-Link WA850 WiFi Extender:<br> If during setup or operation you notice a significate delay in video or sound you could need a wireless extender to boost the WiFI signal.  The TP-Link is an approved Ring 3rd party product and is an excellent extender in the event your Ring video lags due to being a great distance from your central internet ISP router/source.  The configuration was very easy and takes about 3 minutes.  As compared to 5 years ago when extenders where the size of a small computer, these are excellent as they look like a night light when plugged into the electric outlet.  The cost is around $20US and will also boost the wireless on other devices in your home.<br>Ring Customer Service:<br> I’ve used Ring Customer Service several times during installations and troubleshooting some device errors over the 3 months I’ve owned the devices.  I give them top marks for 1) answering the phone with a live person quickly, 2) providing a call back service so you are not on hold for long, and 3) very well educated and knowledge people that understand the product.<br> I’ve called customer support for 1) issues with my preinstalled/preexisting  home doorbell, 2) one of my Stickup Camera’s had technical issues/battery issues, and 3) I lost WiFi connectivity on my RingPro doorbell.  I will address each below, but need to state I’m 100% satisfied with the customer support from Ring.<br>1) Manual doorbell not working: Upon installing the RingPro doorbell, my preexisting doorbell would not ring upon pressing the RingPro button.  Roger from tech support helped me greatly, but in the end, I could not use my home doorbell.  In response, Ring then shipped a Ring Chime for free since their product more or less disabled my home doorbell.  They said, although they have tested hundreds of doorbell models, there are still some they can’t support.<br>2) Camera Battery issues: Upon installing one of my Ring Stick up Camera’s, I could not get the setup to function.  Ring had me depress the orange button the back for 60 sections (factory reset) and perform the setup again.  It worked, thus I was able to install the camera, but I continued to have issues with this device.  The battery only lasted two weeks, so I called Ring and they shipped me another one that arrived quickly and installed without any errors.  So far, it has lasted more than 3 weeks without any issues or loss of battery power.<br>3) Reconnecting RingPro: About 3 months after installing my RingPro doorbell, I could not get the video to come up on my app.  For some reason the device needed to be reset, which is only taking off the cover, depressing the button on the left for 20 seconds until it is in setup mode, and then waiting 30 seconds and pressing the button again.  As with all technology, it needed to be reconnected to my WiFi again.  This was quick and easy.<br>Ring Cloud Storege Service:<br> The Ring cloud storage service allows all video alerts, motion, and live views to be stored on the Cloud for up to 6 months.  This is a crime deterrent as all video is stored off site and can’t be deleted without access to the user id and password on the app.  The cost is $3 per month per device or $30 per device per year.<br> Ring Recommendation:  I would like Ring to offer a home package for the Cloud services up to say 4 video devices instead of charging for each device.

  This thing sounds like an amazing idea and would be awesome if it worked. This doorbell never works properly, it freezes and glitches constantly. I try to pull up the video whenever someone rings the doorbell but by the time the video actually loads up the person is long gone. Then when you try to bring up the recorded video to see who it was, the video is so jerky and glitchy that you can’t tell who it was.<br>I have very strong internet and a very high quality WiFi router that is only about ten feet from the doorbell so you cannot blame these problems on internet connection. I also have various other home connected devices from other companies and they all work fine even though they are a lot further from the WiFi router than this doorbell is. This includes another WiFi connected camera from another company, it works fine even though it is further from my router than this doorbell is. The problem is this is a faulty product and I hope somebody makes a better version of this because it is an awesome idea.

  Works great! High quality video, easy to use app and great field of view on camera. There is about a 1 - 2 second delay on the video (no big deal), and almost instant notification on smartphone. Sound is good not great.<br>For those who are interested in the Pro version but do not have an existing traditional doorbell, this can become a bit involved for those not somewhat ""handy"" around the house. Hiring a professional may be the way to go. But it can be done if you are leaning away from the battery operated Ring Doorbell. There is a separate installation guide available at the Ring website on how to do it. For my situation (available power source, attic/basement access, lack of insulation in walls to easily run wire, etc.), it was a pretty smooth job. 2.5 hours beginning to end.

  The sensitivity is almost too good.  Motion detector had to be set to 'people' since did I really want to be told a leaf moved, lol.  Camera gets everything within range. I think cloud storage is cheap at $3/month, and you can backtrack. I like the hood watch so people post suspicious activities with video.

  Original review 2016<br>We've had this for over a week now and we're really happy with it. The video quality and audio quality are great. Shortly after this was installed there was a break in less than a mile from our house and the ring doorbell just gives us peace of mind. Is there and delay? You bet. Does that really matter to me? Nope. I found out about the ring doorbell from Facebook because my friends were posting videos of packages being stolen or just suspicious activity. I love the community feature in that we always know what is going on within a few mile radius of our home. The only downside to that is I wish we could comment on the videos posted. I love being able to set the motion sensor parameters, we don't get any false alarms because of that feature. I highly recommend this item to my friends and family. I gave this 4 stars because there is still room for improvement, but it's still an excellent product.<br><br>Update 2020: The device is failing. It disconnects frequently from the wifi and I have no idea if it's working or not unless I check the app. The app rarely works these days and I just end up going to the door to see who's there. I'm tempted to just go back to a regular doorbell. Atleast that will work consistently. We have security cameras too and thank goodness. If the ring catches anything at all it's after the person is leaving. The concept has so much promise but not even coming close to what it should do. Very disappointed.

We would recommend this item for security and knowing who is approaching your property. Like being able to answer the door without having to open it to strangers.

  This is a great security device, and very flexible.  It is small and the installation was fairly simple, and it has operated consistently since purchase.  I was concerned that a busy street would cause a lot of false readings but I was able to tweak the area of focus to eliminate extra ""noise.""  I was also concerned about signal drops that others have reported, but so far I have had no problems.  The annual fee to store/review video is reasonable and the features are easy to use.  I like that I can add additional devices as well.

   I used the Ring video doorbell for about three months now. Very reliable and love the voice feature with no pause when your speaking to the person in the video!!! I've used the stick up cam now for about two weeks. Love the audible light ringing when motion is detected! Excellent idea. Better than the competition. Very good continuous coverage on live mode for both cameras! No problems with recording!  I rated 4 stars because they need to upgrade the software on the two cameras I own to include focus when zoomed in. No sense in having a video recording without being able to zoom in and focus to identify who or what is in the picture.

  Works well. Get this over the battery powered one especially if you have an existing doorbell. Well worth it. Wish Ring would develop an adapter for homes with doorbells that are wired into a single gang box. It would make it so much easier to install. It's as simple as making a single gang plate adapter. I bought a double light switch plate and secured it that way so I could keep my existing success gang electrical box where it was.

  This doorbell is amazing! It's not just a doorbell, but also a security camera that enables you to protect your home and deliveries wherever you may be. You aren't chained to your home when you are expecting packages. I've had deliveries that require signature and have been able to speak directly to the messenger and see them leave the package while in route to the house. Since you can watch your front porch in real time, you can ensure that no-one takes your packages before you can retrieve them. I've had people say they've delivered packages and been able to review the footage and prove that they didn't. I've also been able to send away solicitors without having to open the door. Since having a baby and learning the joys of feeding a newborn, it's wonderful that I don't have to get up to answer the door and disrupt those precious feedings. I can tell people to wait a moment or send them away. It's truly a remarkable product that everyone should own. The only thing I would recommend is making sure you have fast enough internet speed. We had 75/75 fibre optic and it wasn't fast enough. We upgraded to 150/150 fibre optic and added 4 other stickup camera from ring (just because we love it so much) and it's perfect. We are also using a stickup camera in our baby's room as a monitor for my husband who travels a lot.

I installed it myself, at night, while nine months pregnant if that says anything about the ease. The quality of the picture is very good and the Ring app has been easy to use and customize. I was surprised when I got a notification that the camera sensed motion at 7:30am and saw that it picked up a school bus driving by. I was easily able to adjust the range for notifications to below the street so I can know if someone is in my yard, but not every time a car drives by. I got this mainly because there is no window next to my front door or peep hole and to let me know when all my packages are left at my door and so far it’s done the job. I would definitely recommend.

  Other than the Ring failing in a week and needing to be replaced, a fact Ring support only acknowledged after I had to rewire and purchase and reinstall power to the defective product, the bell works OK. Buyer be warned! Unlike other competitive ""smart"" doorbells the Ring does not allow viewing onboard recording unless you pay a monthly fee. Simple onboard storage would alleviate this and I suspect the Ring has the storage but locks it down unless you pay. Not a great value proposition for me. I bought the bell so I could see who was at my door not pay Ring for life. Read the fine print and don't be scammed by Ring.

  I installed this doorbell yesterday in about 30 minutes.  The directions were clear and everything was fairly simple.  The only thing that was confusing is the doorbell had three posts and all had wires running off it (there was another door with a doorbell).  The diagram didn't cover this situation and my posts weren't labelled.  But, I guess that the wiring was the same as the diagram and that guess worked right.  I also stuck a little dab of caulk above the wiring area on the unit to divert any water that might get behind the unit.<br><br>The actual configuration of the doorbell was dead simple and it works great.  The only heads-up is to know that car lights at night trick the motion sensor - so every car that went by triggered the alert.  Ring has a capability to turn off the motion sensor on a schedule.  What would be better is, since this is a web service, have the schedule adjust for sun-down at least on a regional basis.  Maybe I can hook up some kind of IFTT thing.

After several hours of troubleshooting with Ring, they finally decided to send me a new one. Installed the new one and now six to seven months later, again the doorbell inside my home does not ring consistently and the camera locks up 50% of the time when going to live view or trying to answer door when someone pushes button. I asked Ring for a refund and they said I would have to get that from Amazon, but they did offer to replace my doorbell again. Amazon would not provide refund because I was past the 30 day refund mark, but they did give me $30 credit. I am going to cut my loss and throw this POS in the trash, install my old doorbell button and install a good Nest camera. Unless you want to spend a lot of time troubleshooting and trying to make a doorbell work don't buy this product.

  I read everything I could find before ordering, and chose the Pro version because 1) ability to customize motion zones, and 2) powered by existing doorbell transformer. I live in an area where we have months of cold temps, and did not want to deal with battery issues.<br>When the product arrived, the outer shipping box was intact, but the actual product packaging was in terrible shape...obviously had been opened, some small parts missing, and the packaging semi-crushed. Very surprised it got shipped that way. I believe this was an Amazon problem, not a Ring problem. Since I wanted to get it installed that weekend, I ended up returning the one ordered, and replaced it with one from Home Depot. Install went smoothly. The iPhone app is great. I anticipated glitches, and really haven't experienced any. Mounting it flat on the wall next to my front door did not give me the coverage of my front porch that I wanted, so i searched for angled mounting brackets and found them, both from Ring and other sources. Got a mount that gives me a 40 degree angle...perfect. Have had it up for a couple of weeks now, and am pleased with it to the point that i intend to add one or more Ring cameras for other views around the exterior of my house. The cloud recording works well, and the cost of $30/year is reasonable, but I wish they would offer a multi-camera cloud recording plan instead of $30/year for each and every camera. The only issue i have had is that my real doorbell does not chime correctly since I installed the Ring unit, and rather than trying to figure it out, I just ordered a Ring Chime. It works great, and delivers a much louder chime than my ""real"" doorbell. Looking forward to seeing how they expand the line of products.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Technology with some issues on the WiFi side of things.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2017","<span>
  I have had this installed for a few weeks now and it is a huge boost to my home security.  I get alerted anytime someone approaches the door.  Today I answered my first remote (away from home) door bell ring.  I saw the person and had a long conversation with them for about an hour.  Pretty cool, right?  In addition to the hardware the software piece is fairly decent as well.  I have trimmed my ""alert zone"" ( to remove people walking by on the side walk) so that I only get truly alerted when people approach my door.  This feature works with roughly 99% accuracy.  So why am I giving it a 4 star rating?  The WiFi sucks on this.  My wifi router is roughly 15 feet away from my front door and all I could get was a poor signal which is not enough for this to function properly.  I had to buy the wall plug signal booster to get this to work properly.  So unless your router is within line of sight of the doorbell, plan on probably having to get the booster.  I was shocked that I needed to for that short of a distance but I did need it.  Overall, this is a great device if installed near enough to a wifi router.

  Having great difficulties getting this product to work.  I have been on the phone with customer services for hours trying to get ring pro to work.  The WiFi signal was too weak so I received a Chime pro to amplify the signal.  That did not work. Now they are sending me another Chime pro in hopes it will work and link up to the ring pro.  I just got a strange email from customer service saying they now need my credit card on my account.  This was never mentioned in the 2hour phone call with them. Something not right about this company. Product and it’s linkage to WiFi just does not work. And customer service is sketchy.

  This review would be a 5 except for the several hours it took to get things setup and running.  I got 4 Ring products, 2 Ring Doorbell pros, a flood light camera, and a spot light camera.  Two of them (one door bell, and the spot light), setup up and worked great.  The other two took several calls to tech support and lots of trial and error to finally get them working.  I have to say that their support people were great to work with.  I don't know if my problems were unique but it took a bunch of work to finally get everything working.<br><br>To make a long story short, I use a Netgear Nighthawk AC3000 Tri-band router.  To get the last two cameras to setup correctly I had to connect them through a Netgear Nighthawk mesh extender (signal strength was not a problem, they would not connect sitting 3 feet from the router.)  After everything was setup, all the cameras would work connecting to the mesh extender or to the router.<br><br>My personal opinion is that the camera setup software was quitting the setup process too soon and claiming I had a bad internet connection when there really was not a problem.  Once everything was setup, it all works great.

  I found the door bell to be well engineered and manufactured. Installation faithfully followed the instructions in the documentation, and with one small exception, I was VERY pleased with both the outcome and the process.<br><br>Exception: The original electro-mechanical chime/bell ceased operating after installation. I watched several Youtube videos on troubleshooting this issue, BUT then something happened. Someone came to the door and rang the Ring. Since I had already enabled the Alexa skill for Ring, Alexa immediately announced the visitor's arrival. Know what? I prefer the announcement by Alexa to the original chime/bell. AND, the dog doesn't go nuts with the Alexa announcement like she did when someone rang the old door bell. Not bad!

  I bought a Ring Doorbell Pro nearly a year ago prior to some work being done on my house.  Once the work was done (nearly a year later) I went to install the doorbell and couldn't get it to connect to my wifi.  After much time on the phone with customer service and walking through every step that could be part of the problem we rewired, added a new transformer and the doorbell still did not work.  Ring sent me a new doorbell (arrived within days) with the latest model even though I had bought my original doorbell nearly a year ago.  The doorbell was set up in 5 minutes and works beautifully.  Customer service was great in the amount of time they spent on the phone with us troubleshooting the problem and this was over the holidays so I am sure they were inundated with calls from new purchasers.  Thanks Ring!

I was  able to do a live check on the front door and side of the house from over 1000 miles away.  When we returned the floodlight cam detected our approaching car from 200 feet away.

  Was hesitant because of the issues people report regarding lags/delays in notifications.  However, we have super speed internet at home and have no issues.  My phone chimes with a notification as soon as there is motion, before someone can even reach for the doorbell.  I'd buy it again, and recommend to my family members.  Within the first week it came in handy; I was upstairs with the kids and was able to hear someone approach and tell them I'll be right down.  Before the Ring I couldn't hear someone down stairs at the front door.  I'm pleased that it does exactly what it's meant to do.

  I'm being generous with a 3 star rating.  Doorbell camera is a great idea and is fantastic when it works. Unfortunately, the doorbell goes offline like every other day. The unit does not reconnect on its own. The fix advised by customer service is to reset the device. This entails removing the cover and holding down the hidden button on the side of the unit. I have done this so many times that I have stripped out the little retaining screw that secures the cover on. My internet service is provided by Comcast and is very fast. The doorbell is less than 30 feet from the router; so the issue is the doorbell.  I love the concept but the software/unit is just too unreliable to recommend.<br>Just an ironic aside, I reset the unit last night. I am writing this in my office and I thought I would snap a picture of the view from the doorbell, but cannot. The doorbell is offline again.

  ********** Update<br>I’ve been working with Ring support on a couple issues so there will be future updates to the review.  However, I have to say their support has been 2nd to none and I’m very pleased with how they’ve treated me and their dedication towards customer satisfaction.<br>**********<br><br>This is the second Ring Pro we’ve had.  The first one unfortunately had something wrong with it such that it randomly wouldn’t work at all and thus had to be replaced with another unit.  I’m pleased to say the second unit we received is working much better and all the core issues the first one had (intermittent behavior of it not working as a simple doorbell, needing to be reset constantly) are gone.  I hope this review serves to help educate people, cause while this can be a great product, there are a few “gotchas” you have to be aware of so you don’t have a bad experience like I initially did.<br><br>So, what’s good about the Ring Pro?  Well quite a few things…  The fact that you always know when someone either walks up your entryway or rings your doorbell, regardless if you are at home, work, or on vacation somewhere, is awesome!  If the postman drops off a package and you’re not home, you know about it and can take action.  If a neighbor or someone you know stops by and you’re not home, you can talk to them through the Ring’s built in intercom, which is pretty cool.  If a solicitor shows up, you know without having to tiptoe to the door and peep through the hole or answer the door, if you’re not at home and the kids have some “friends” come over, you know about it.  Mostly though, just the reassurance and security that you know who’s coming &amp; going, can see who it is, talk to them if you want, you know exactly what’s going on in front of your home and are in control.  It’s like cell phones, do you absolutely need one to survive?  No, but is life so much better, safer, and more secure with one?  Absolutely yes…  The Ring’s app is pretty well done and you can fine tune many features &amp; settings including dialing in the motion zones &amp; sensitivity such that it doesn’t just go off when a car drives by or a plane fly’s overhead<br><br>An important thing worth noting, to have videos recorded (which I strongly recommend) and stored in the Ring cloud such that you can review and or download them later requires a subscription, but luckily it’s only $3 a month or $30 for the year if you pay up front.  And you can add on additional cameras as well if you want to turn it into a quasi-security system, which will bump the subscription cost some.<br><br>Now what’s not so good?  The Ring technology while very good isn’t perfect yet, but with software &amp; firmware updates it has the potential to be.  For example, fine tuning the motion zones and sensitivity isn’t perfect and you get the occasional false alarm, but mostly it’s small stuff like that.  But moreover, the Ring Pro has to rely upon certain aspects of your home such as your existing doorbell’s power &amp; Wi-Fi.  So, with perfect dependencies, comes a nearly perfect product.  However, if dependencies are less than ideal, then the Ring suffers through no fault of its own, and that’s potentially some of the issues I’m working through with their support team at the moment.  For example, the Ring Pro requires an existing wired 16-24 volt doorbell, and if the transformers power output is on the low end, things get complicated.  And once installed you may have performance issues with the in-house chime not ringing as loud or possibly with the Ring itself.  However, most average home owners (including myself) aren’t just going to know this or how to diagnose, Amazon Q&amp;A can help, but that’s a lot of hit &amp; miss reading...  Regarding WI-FI, everything else in your house may work just fine, heck I’m able to stream 4k videos through Netflix.  However, the Ring apparently has some finicky requirements of its own, or so I suspect.  If the wireless router isn’t close enough to the Ring or there are too many obstructions, the video quality may and can have any number of problems from artifacts to downright freezing up.  Again, I’m working through these issues right now with their support and will update this review, hopefully with good or informative news once I know more.  The blessing is they are good to work with and seemingly committed to helping me out and provide a good customer experience, which is a breath of fresh air.<br><br>So, for now 4/5 stars, in large part due to their customer support.  If we get the remaining issues resolved it will surely be a 5/5

  For the most part, it works very well.  It is very nice to get ring and motion notifications on my phone. However, the motion detection could be improved.  For instance, rain water drops from above can cause motion to be detected. Lighting changes without an actual object moving can also cause motion to be detected (e.g. front porch lights, a street light turning on or off at night or car headlights flashing across a bush).

  Works as described, but not very quickly. It is not very often that people are patient enough to still be at the door by the time it finally comes up on my phone. Could be my phone too.. idk? But I mainly bought for the security aspect and I like that if something does happen, I have video proof. Night vision doesn't work the best either btw. Overall, I still love the product and the idea, just wish it worked a little better. Maybe I'll have a better experience with a phone upgrade?? (Still using an iPhone 5)

  I've had a Ring doorbell since it first came out. It is easily the nicest feature that I have added to my house. I'm able to get rid of the solictators from my couch and I'm able to make sure that my packages are always left and I never come home to the dreaded ""Sorry we missed you but if you want your package you have to drive across town to find it"" letters. This new version is so much smaller yet way more powerful. The camera is great and the performance is awesome. My neighbors have since installed a similar products and I've been able to see how mine compares. I'm not one who enjoys having anything less than the best and I still have the ring doorbell so that should say everything you need to know right there.

  Its great to not have to run to the door and find out it was a prank or worse yet a salesperson.  Also great when friends come over and you are not there, so you can talk to them and arrange to meet later.  My only issue is that my existing doorbell was installed right next to some molding that prevented the video from getting a good view.  I have just realized there are additional mounts available that should be able to alleviate that obstacle from view and very inexpensive at that. Can't wait to try that out.

  From start to finish it has been a breeze.  I paid for installation through Amazon because our original doorbell hadn't worked for years.  The installer, Innovative Trades, were professional and made sure to walk me through everything they were doing.  They replaced my original doorbell chime for an additional charge which was perfectly fine.  The additional charged was billed through Amazon.  Once everything was up and running, they cleaned up any mess they made (which was very little) and made sure to instruct me on how to use the product.  Very friendly and professional, loved the service.  I have had the Ring product for a few days now and Love it!  Will be recommending this product and the outstanding services of Amazon and Innovative Trades to friends and family.

  Initial setup was fine. Worked for 20 minutes then disconnected from WiFi for no apparent reason, signal is very strong on the front porch. Tried to go through the setup process again with no success. Called Ring support and after 35 minutes of testing and verifying proper setup I was told that there has been issues with this model lately where it will work for a short period of time, then stop working, and never go back into setup mode.

  I purchased the Ring Pro and installed it this week. Installation was a breeze by following the instructions. The very next day we already needed it. We are having a new roof installed at our house and the shingle delivery company came five days earlier than the contractor was expecting. We would not have known anyone came to our house that day for delivery without Ring notifying us. We were able to reach out to the contractor who then communicated what needed to be done. They would have charged us a second delivery fee if they had to come back.<br>The product works great. The 1080HD quality is very nice and very clear. I really like the quality of the App and all of its functionality and information. I would highly recommend this product. Keep in mind that the Pro Version requires you to have a standard powered doorbell in order to power the Ring unit. I like this because I won't have to charge the battery every month or so.

  I will start out by saying the concept of the camera doorbell combination is brilliant. The overall execution of that concept is very good. I used an angle mount (available separately) to tilt the camera more toward the door to center the action. I also used a Wi-Fi range extender on the other side of the wall to insure a strong Wi-Fi signal at the device. In addition, I learned that my doorbell was running on 6 volts for the last 23 years. The good news is that my transformer had a 16 volt tap as well so I switched it to the 16 volt side with is required for this device.<br>OPERATION<br>The picture quality was beyond expectations both day and night. Once I loaded the app and set up a motion sensor zone, it worked very well sending alerts to my phone and PC when something was detected.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and Customer Service!!,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2016","<span>
  I've been very happy with the Ring Pro doorbell so far.  I did have trouble with my initial device and contacted their customer service about possible solutions and it turned out after trying a few different options that my device was DOA.  They quickly sent me a replacement (which was great since Amazon was on backorder) and the replacement setup as expected.  It was a bit slow the first day until it updated it's firmware and ever since has been working very fast and the picture quality is very good for such a small camera.  I also got the Ring Doorbell so I could eliminate my indoor mechanical chime that was both obnoxiously loud and only made my dogs bark like crazy.  The Ring doorbell has some nice tone options and adjustable volume.  I might get another for the garage soon.

  It’s great to be able to feel at ease while on vacation and get notified if there’s  any movement at my front door. It’s also nice because I check what time family members are coming and going and make sure the kids get home safe after school. My dog got out the back door and went around the front and the ring doorbell notified me he was outside of my house. So instead of a nice walk through the neighborhood he only made it to the front of the house. So far I am happy with the product.

  The concept is great, answering your door remotely.  The technology, however, simply isn't there.  The servers are going down consistently, and the app is so slow, by the time the event loads, your visitor is long gone.  Another instance of not having the infrastructure to meet the demand.  Suggest waiting a bit to let tech and support catch up with popularity.  Oh, and once you subscribe to their cloud storage service, the app slows even more (5 minutes to watch an event).

  We were worried about the wifi at first because it told us our connection was weak and we figured we would have problems. We have had almost no problems. There are a couple instances where it doesn't alert me until the person(family member) is already through my door or the person delivering a package has come and gone out of view so I have to go back and watch the recorded video to see what occurred.

  This is a really helpful device and definitely makes me feel safer with my wife and kids at home alone throughout the day. The app is intuitive and works really well.

  My home office is very far back in my home and I needed something to let me know when someone was at the front of the house as my traditional doorbell could barely be heard.  I bought the Pro and added the separate Chime for when i don't have my phone on me and both work great.<br><br>I was nervous about the installation, but it was really simple (hardest part was finding which breaker in my circuit box led to the doorbell) and all of the appropriate hardware was included for different variables with the install.<br><br>The motion sensor is the best part for me as i have plenty of packages being dropped off throughout the week.  With a little tweaking of the settings you can get it just right for only when someone is on the porch.<br><br>The only negatives i have with the product is the strength of the wifi and no support for Windows 7 application - i have absolutely no problems with Wifi in or outside of my home (roughly 4000 sq ft and 3 floors) but the doorbell constantly gives me a weak RSSI reading.  I tested another IOT wifi device (similar size and only battery powered) and it gives me a strong reading even in the same location as the doorbell, so i'm assuming the chipset on the doorbell is a little on the weaker side.  the poor RSSI reading has not affected the product from working as expected though.  Just hoping a firmware update might help solve it.  If the signal was a little stronger on the device, and there was a Win7 desktop app,  I'd give it a 5 star<br><br>

  Ring Pro needs some major upgrades.  Set up was great but it keeps losing connections.  The app freezes, connections need to be rebooted (which means you have to unscrew the cover to hit reset button) and the in house bell rang only the first day (now it only rings on the unit and phone). The upside is when it works it is awesome.  Picture is great! Notifications are timely and consistent.  I love that we can change the motion area.  I really wish they would upgrade the software because the idea is great and they are off to a great start.  It wasn't worth the price at this point.

  Easy to install if you have a pre-existing wired doorbell. Unfortunately I found out the hard way that I did not and had a Battey operated remote doorbell. I was able to run to my local hardware store and buy a transformer to hook off of an existing light switch and wire my own 16 volt access. Aside from my own incompetence the ring app is absolutely terrible on both apple and Android phones. The app does not load quick enough to talk to a guest at my door. You also need to buy a $3 month subscription to access the recordings. I would rate lower but my ring system stopped working after 8 months due to a manufacturing defect and the customer support replaced my system free of charge. Although the live feed lags even with a high speed internet service provider the recordings are high quality and provides a level of security that is unmatched by other expensive private alarm companies.

  We had the Ring doorbell installed recently, and have been very happy pleased with our choice. Our earlier doorbell was mounted perpendicularly to the entryway, so we had to mount Ring the same way. Ring, however, has a huge field of view, and by installing the Ring wedge, it captures people while they're at the door as well as when they walk up to the door, which is perfect. Furthermore, it does not flood me with notifications all day long for stray movements, but is excellent at picking up movements directly at the door. The recording feature is great too, although a concern I have on that front is how much bandwidth it uses (we have 5 Nest cameras as well as this Ring, which is a lot of upload bandwidth). On the whole, I would recommend Ring strongly.

  This device is great and the resolution is fantastic.  Before you purchase, make sure your existing wiring is putting out at least 16VAC at the existing doorbell.

I also needed to use the black back plate to cover up the hole where the previous doorbell plate was.

  Great idea if it only worked.  Installed as per directions.  Video is fine but Audio is basically unusable.  There is noise and feedback that make it virtually impossible to carry on any conversation.  Read all the reviews and decided I needed to change the doorbell transformer, which I did.  Still no good. Tried Hard reset, changing volume setting on phone, etc, etc.  Audio still not usable.  The app is ok but not great.  If, after connecting to the doorbell, you close the app rather than hit the red (hangup) button, the doorbell keeps the audio channel open.  which means you can't get another ring notification.

  Great device, good video and audio quality, easy installation, and easy to use app.  This works wonderfully for us and from what I read results can vary depending upon internet speeds.  We have 100 mbps download/upload speeds, but of course outside at the front door (or anywhere not right next to the router of course) is a much different story.  Still, speed tests outside our front door clock in around 15-20 mbps pretty consistently and that seems to be plenty for this to function without delay and lag.  I love the live view feature, the ability to draw a custom motion detection zones, and the fact that it is not as wide as the original ring - it just barely fits on my door frame in the old doorbell button location.  My only minor complaint is the 2-3 second lag between when the button is pushed and the actual doorbell chime in the house, but this is easily made up for by the  zero lag time between button push and notification on my mobile devices.  That notification pushes instantly.  Overall it has exceeded our expectations, highly recommended.

  Definitely an improvement over the original Ring Doorbell.  The ability to draw a sensitivity to motion pattern is a great feature.  This avoids unnecessary motion detection but also allows for detection in areas where the original bell would not.  Our original Ring doorbell (that we have now moved to our side door) would not pick up the mailman because it did not detect motion low enough in the frame since our front door is 5 steps up from the front sidewalk and mailbox.  I could also lower the top detection area to not pick up large vehicles on the street.  Also the Doorbell Pro has a smaller profile and blends in better on the door frame.  The only downside to the Ring Pro is that it has no battery so it has to be wired directly to the original doorbell wiring.  We had to replace our interior doorbell chime and transformer because the old one in our old house was not of sufficient voltage.  At least I have enough do-it-yourself talent to do it myself.

1.0 out of 5 stars,WiFi unreliable and customer service time consuming and repetitive,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020","<span>
  When it worked, it was great.  But it dropped wifi on 2 occasions.  Once I was able to reestablish it, but a couple of months later it happened again.  I spent hours (not exaggerating!) with customer service via chat, replaced the transformer as they were certain that was it and still nothing.  Finding 'chat' in the app is difficult.  It's easy to get to FAQs but getting to people is a challenge.  I'm also apprehensive to try again as the rep promised they would replace the unit if the transformer didn't, but every time you contact them they make you go through all the trouble shooting and that's another hour of my life I'll never get back.  I've done it twice already with them, and several times on my own.  Disappointed.

  Excellent product so far (have had it over a month.)  Easy installation.  Software installation intuitive.  Excellent picture quality.  The RING network for notifications is not always instantaneous, but only lags a few seconds in most cases.  Will be interesting to see if more lag develops after the Christmas induced load on their network happens (more RINGS sold means more notifications will compete for communication.)

There are very few problems with this product and non that should prevent you from purchasing it.<br><br>I encountered two problems:<br>1) the volume of the voice coming out of the ring unit when you are using the intercom feature is a little too low, but it does not break up like previous models.<br><br>2) I am a network specialist (that's my experience qualifier). At home, I have the latest 802.11AC accesspoints with band steering and all the good stuff set up to industry standards.

  Installation took a while due to weak signal.  Checked wire connectors for continuity and voltage.  Wired into an older doorbell and had to tighten the screws for  good connection.  Once I move my router to improve coverage it installed a lot easier after 2 to3 attempts.  It helps to reset and install again.  I did not contact support to walk me through, but knew I could call as a last resort.  It takes a while for the software to update, but once it is installed It has worked like a champ.  I have an average signal, but the Ring works very well for my almost weak signal.  No complaints I like it.

  This is no doubt one of favorite things. I was doubtful that I could install it myself but Ring provides everything you need. It's all in the box except a drill.

  Quick summary:<br><br>DO NOT BUY, bad video quality, bad streaming, bad sound quality, works 2/10 times, and when it does work the video is choppy or freezes. The recorded events cost 30 extra dollars a year but only save black screens, still images, or if you're lucky a bit of sound with grey very pixelated images.<br><br>Long Summary:<br><br> ""Video"" should be called ""Still Frame"" or ""Black screen"" and even if it starts to work you can assume its choppy, poor quality, and tears through the entire video and there's no way you'll figure out who was at your door. I paid for the 30 dollar 1 year cloud service so I could at least watch recorded motion which worked for one month but once the free trial was over and they hit my card, it starts only recording black screen or still image.<br><br>Messaged support and they tried to blame my internet, nope 300 down 30 up. Power supplied to the device says ""Very Good"", wireless signal is ""Very good"" according to device health. I've messed with every router setting my netgear nighthawk has to offer and even dropped it on the DMZ, still no luck. I disconnected everything on my network, and basically turned my router into a single device modem with no firewall that would only respond to ring, still nothing. I bought a wireless range extender, opened all the ports, tested the speeds with my phone, laptop, ipad to make sure the AP didn't drop it too much then took all devices off the network and tried it again, still nothing.<br><br>I replaced the device, still nothing.<br><br>Side note, I have bought 3 Yi cameras for less than $80 each and all of them stream perfectly on android, iphone, PC and MAC, and don't cost a penny extra to view recorded events, instead they use a SD cards. For some reason ring wants to blame my hardware when I can stream 3 others with no issue? And yes I took them off the network for the ring to make sure they weren't killing bandwidth...no change to ring's quality.<br>.<br>Please save your money and buy ANY other product. I've tried everything and even their support is a train wreck. After being ""escalated to level 2"" and responding to the email twice they said I hadn't responded and closed the ticket. I tried 2 more times and I guess I'm being filtered to spam. ALL their support emails go to google spam, even after selecting ""this is not spam"" in gmail.

  very dissatisfied with this product. Very deceitful. After the ""1 month trial phase"" of the video recording service, the ring doorbell stops displaying live video of the person. I did multiple reboots of the doorbell. I also upgraded my wifi and spent additional $500 to see if it would improve the connection. After all the measures I have still the same problem, whenever someone rings the bell it will give notification and I cannot view the video in live cast. I called the technical department and got a reply that basically I have to purchase the ""recording service"" in order to view the live case when someone rings the doorbell. If I do not wish to buy the recording service then the other option given to me was, ""when someone rings the doorbell, I get the notification and I should open the app and go to ""Live View"" in order to see who's there. This was truly a waste of $200.. I can install a high quality camera with regular doorbell and can view the Live view option. Thanks but no thanks for the ""notification"" for ringing the doorbell.

  First the good. Install was cake. It was a bit larger than I expected, but fit between my door frame and storm door just right. Inside install was as simple as wiring two wires from the chime. It took about 15 minutes to complete, the worst part is either the screwdriver is not magnetic or the screw (for the front cover) is non-ferrous. That screw was a pain to get started in a tight spot. The app and notifications work well. I only had one error and i think that was my wifi. It doesn't eat up a ton of data.<br><br>The first 2 days I had it, the neighbor's house was broken into. I found out when 5 patrol cars were on the street. Not a good thing to find, but I was able to see what was going on and call neighbors. We keep watching closely and I expanded the zone further, I don't know if this is a blessing or a curse! This is just a really cool way to keep an eye on things if you have nothing else and want a simple install.<br><br>There are a few issues I have noted:<br><br>-Can't modify notification sounds. The chime is pretty annoying. I really would like some options or some default iPhone choices.<br>-The app also starts with the camera in landscape but tries to show it in portrait on the top part of the screen, cutting off half the picture<br>-Image quality is not good enough to make out car details or plates from 50 feet or more away. The zoom is really worthless due to it being grainy.<br>-In night mode there is a reflection of the camera off the face and you can see the camera's reflection in the video.<br>-Lights going on and off at my patio trigger motion. Same with lights of cars entering the neighborhood, even though the entrance is out of the zone.<br>-When ringing the bell, it first gives feedback at the door bell, then the app, then the inside wired door bell. I would like to get the inside bell right away and see that sequence speed up, it can be laggy.<br>-There is a bad reflection off the brick from the IR lights. Honestly my yard lights up well and I can see things better with it off. I wish it was adjustable in some advanced setting.<br><br>Overall this is nice for deliveries, foot traffic and strange cars. I like it for the ability to pay $30/year and record all triggered motion. I would have purchased a camera only, but finding out it was $30/device that turned me off. With the other issues I noted, I decided to install a 4 camera system that records to a harddrive and with a power supply backup I never miss a thing. This way I can monitor all borders of my property and if someone wants to disconnect or damage a low camera, I already have them recorded on several others mounted high at main point of interest. The things I noted are minor, but a fix would gain the 5th star.

  Be careful buying this product as it won't necessarily work, even if your existing hardwiring meets all the requirements. My doorbell transformer meets the 16V 10VA requirements stated by ring, but the product doesn't work. After 2 hours chatting to ring the only solution they came up with was to use a ring transformer, which requires using a dedicated outlet and drilling holes in multiple walls. After searching, it seems that many people have had a similar problem and has only been solved by changing their existing doorbell transformer to a 16V 30VA unit. While this is only a $20+ purchase, it would still have been nice to know before purchase and most big box hardware stores do not stock a 16V 30VA transformer (almost all houses with a mechanical doorbell have a 16V 10VA transformer and this is what the stores stock). It wasn't until I mentioned using the different transformer, after searching the web, did the ring support staff say that it would solve the problem.

  This is a decent device that works well. It has one big annoyance though: there is a bug in the firmware that causes the infrared lights to turn off and then back on exactly every 10 minutes. This has wreaked havoc with both my motion sensors and security camera by causing a motion event and triggers the security cameras to record. There are many discussions in various forums about this issue but apparently Ring is not willing to fix it.

  We are very impressed with our new Ring!  It gives us such peace of mind knowing our house is being monitored for anyone that comes to the front door.  There is an option to have it notify you only when someone rings your doorbell or you can also have it notify you if there is any motion detected at the front door.  We set our motion detector every evening before going to bed (it is a little sensitive during the day and goes off quite a bit but that's a good thing that it is so sensitive!).  It is such peace of mind knowing our home is being monitored with an outside security system for a fraction of the cost of an outside security system.  It was easy to install, customer service has been amazing-can't say enough good things about Ring.  Do yourself a favor and protect you and your family by purchasing a Ring-you'll thank yourself later!

  When the ring Pro works correctly, it's fine. The issue is that it rarely works correctly for more than a few days at a time. Either the video is black, there is no audio, it cannot connect, and/or the doorbell in the house and / or on the phone doesn't ring. I had a contractor install it. He is looked at it twice plus an electrician has looked at it. I bought the chime pro extender. I did all the testing that ring support says to do. And it's still rarely works for more than a few days at a time.

So impressed, I've ordered a second one for my side door. The problem has been when I setup the front door bell it continually goes off-line.  I have the pro power kit installed but the power drops and it goes off-line every night.  I have ordered a new bell transformer which is more powerful than the one I have now.  Hopefully that will correct the problem.  I have a very narrow space and the Pro fits - it would be nice if it was a bit longer and had a couple of button batteries to provide power to keep the bell active when the power drops.

This has been amazing as the small design, motion sensors, warning when someone comes to the door and ability to see and talk to them has been amazing! The size of the Pro unit is great as it is much smaller than the original and can fit on a  door that just has trim around the sides. I had to cut out some detail trim to have it fit properly but it wasn't a big deal and now looks built into that trim piece. Also it was super easy to install!

  This product says it works with doorbells requiring 16-24 volts.  The transformer for my doorbell (like most) is 16v which meets the requirement (in fact, my doorbell is exactly the same as the one used in their set-up video).  Well folks, this is misleading marketing.  16 volts won't cut it.  Neither will 20v.  Yes, you need a 24 volt transformer to make this work.  Most likely, you don't have this unless you have specifically wired your house for this.  After hours of testing and calling tech support, I found this out the hard way.  Tech support was a bumbling comedy circus.  I'm pretty sure they are flying by the seats of their pants.  Now I have a useless piece of scrap metal, not to mention two holes drilled into my masonry.  I've dealt with few companies who were more deceptive than this one.  Lesson learned.  I would avoid products from this company at all cost.

Last voltage always reads ""very good"" so there is now power issue from the house end.  Obviously it's not the transformer and it's just a bad Ring unit.

  I bought 5 Ring cameras several years ago and was mostly pleased.  As time has gone by I am far less happy.  They keep changing the user interface and it keeps getting more complicated and much slower to see and especially activate the camera for communication.  It seems ring has forgotten this a security camera  and that speedy access is the most important function.  Now it is multiple steps with tiny buttons to navigate, I suppose some programming engineer is try to justify their salary with new features that take away from the quick access needed to see if your property is in jeopardy.  I can no longer recommend this product.

  The Ring doorbell was very easy to install when replacing an existing doorbell. We love the wide angle shot. It covers our entire front porch and driveway. The added security, knowing who's at the door, and the talk back feature are awesome. The option and ease of defining detection zones is extremely useful considering the street is in view and triggers motion detection whenever a vehicle drives by. I was able to eliminate that vehicle detection while keeping the more important driveway, sidewalk and porch zones. We are now planning to add several Ring spotlight cams to cover other areas of our home. Happy, happy, happy!

I called support, to ask them why? first thing they ask me to check the status on my app.. ask me the voltage status, i was answer it ""good"" then they ask me the ""signal"" of the connection, then i say, it ""fail""... but even i have really good signal around the house very strong.  Then they told me the product it bad, and return for refund.<br><br>Then i get the second one. It happen the same thing.<br>Guess What? it not the product it bad, it turn out the ring doorbell pro required 12v from the transformer to get enough power to get the strong signal.  So i checked my transformer it only 10V.  I bought new Transformer have 16v to replace my old 10v.  It Work Great.<br><br>So before you think to get the Ring Doorbell pro, make sure you check your transformer it has 10v or 12v+.  If 10v you need to replace it.<br><br>i give 5 star, because the customer service give me a opportunity better deal on my second one :)).

  Our doorbell does not face the street, rather, it is mounted on a side wall facing the neighbor's house.  I've had to fiddle with motion zones (thank goodness we have that option with the pro) and sensitivity to avoid leaves moving in the wind, car headlights projected on the door, and sunrise (it faces ESE).  All of this leads to a lot of non-interesting videos being stored to our cloud service and a lot of alerts that go ignored, since every 3:00 AM motion alert so far has been a car passing.  If someone is actually at the door at 3:00 AM, I might never watch it.  4 Stars because the product delivers on its promises with an incredibly friendly product with great setup and app.  Its just in our case maybe the whole concept is not quite the best implementation or solution for us.

  It seems to me that the tech in this product is not fully developed. Mounted in place of original doorbell button and got a reading of ""good"" for wifi. Because I wanted a straight on view I moved it to the other side of the door which puts it three feet closer to my router and the signal dropped from "" good"" to ""ok"". When I tested it from outside the audio breaks up to the point that I needed to repeat myself several times for my wife to hear me. We have a 150Mpbs cable connection and the Ring doorbell is 18 feet from the router. I tested the signal both inside by the door and outside and I'm losing some signal but really how much does this thing need? If you have DSL this would never work. I've ordered a repeater which I'll mount as close as possible to the door but I doubt it will make much difference. I'll update this post if it does. Love the idea of this product but the reality of it is disappointing.

  I was unable to get the motion detector to work, and kept getting an error message. After reinstalling the hardware and the app, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that it was a known issue with Windows 10 and there was no fix available. There was also no visual available when the doorbell was rung, but it was available on replay. The replay however was usually only a single frame with no one visible unless the stood in just the right spot for a fairly long period of time. This may have been due to weak Wi-Fi signal, but I was tired of troubleshooting. Representatives seem fairly unconcerned, as if they've heard this many times before. I had also been considering the floodlight camera, but rep said that would have the same problem, because it's in the app, not the device.

  This was fairly easy to install. I had to move some wiring but once it was hooked up, it was ready to go very quickly. I did have some slight hiccups with delay the first day, but the kinks seem to have worked themselves out now. My wife thought it was just another tech gadget that I bought, but less than a week later, she was telling me how much she loved being able to look out the front door and talk to someone without actually having to go to the door to see who it is. She said she feels a lot safer with it and not longer as to worry about ""is the screen door locked?"" or ""could they get through my screen door while my front door is open?"" The stickup cameras were nice too. The only reason it's not 5 stars is I had to buy the wifi extender to get all the cameras to have a good signal. None were unrealistically far from my router, so their wifi range seemed weak. However, we do like the different ring-tones the wifi-extender/speaker gives.

  I'd probably rate this more like 4.5 stars. I LOVE the product but sometimes there is more lag than I'd like, stuttery video or sometimes I get a black screen when trying to view live video on cellular connections. This may or may not be the product's problem at all and simply my WiFi strength or speed — but we have plenty of coverage and speed available. I think the only room for improvement might be a faster processor (if it is NOT the Internet connection) and a louder speaker. For the person at the door it's a little hard to hear if there is any surround noise (i.e. kids playing in the immediate area or anything other than a peaceful neighborhood calm). Aside from those issues, they are minor compared to the benefit we get from the safety and comfort provided by this product. I just bought a Ring Floodlight Cam for the backdoor and can't wait to install it soon.

There is no way to reset the device from the app. I called support and they told me tough luck, since I have a covered porch it's going to keep happening. It's obviously not a problem with the amount of light because 1) it worked fine the first week and 2) when the device is reset it automatically flips to day/color mode because there is enough light! I told customer service it's obviously a contrast/firmware problem on their end and they just said ""you have the latest firmware.""

  Outstanding in every way. Set up was simple, connection was flawless and use is intuitive. Image is very clear and sensitivity is excellent. The doorbell notifies you almost immediately when someone approaches the door or rings the doorbell.<br><br>Only concern I have is what will video review and playback be like when 30 day cloud subscription expires.

  This product misses my milk deliveries every week!  The milk man has to walk right up to it to put my milk in the box below it.  It is the only device on my WiFi that has a consistently bad signal. Additionally, by the time the video sets up on my phone for me to answer the door the person is gone - this happens EVERY time someone comes to the door.  I would take a refund in a heartbeat. It is a horrible product that does not do what it advertises.

  The Ring Pro doorbell has exceeded my expectations. It is a clear and focused image and video play back. This product was recommended to me by a co-worker who works with me in IT. I have expanded to the security motion light with camera and just as satisfied with it. Both were easy to install and sync up with my secure home WiFi.

  Not good at all so far. I reached out to their customer service for help and they are nice people but not helpful at all so far. They seem only available via email and are slow to respond. They want to blame all issues with the camera on your internet speeds and that is not the case. I would call this a novelty at best and certainly not worth what it costs. I have not returned it yet but plan to if they can't help me to get it working reasonably. It does not pick up motion whatsoever at night which renders it useless as far as I'm concerned. It also picks up the change early in the morning from infrared to normal as motion so every phone/device with their app goes off with their silly ring tone at the break of dawn daily. This is really annoying.

  Love it! The install was easy, and I had to install a device on the doorbell for this product. Instructions were easy to follow, and there are install videos on the ring website. Motion detector is great, and the night vision is also good. I like the peace of mind this doorbell give us. Make sure you have the correct amount of voltage for this model to work properly. If you have a modern doorbell you’re probably fine. If you live in a really old home or have an old doorbell system, I’d opt to get the battery powered version.

Went to install at my new home and found out my builder used a wireless doorbell so no external electrical source.  Had electrician coming for other work and he quickly pulled the wire and helped install.  I paired it with an Augustus door lock and really works well being able to coordinate deliveries and confirm the right people and right number of people are going in and out.  Have seen at least 2 package thieves cut and run when they saw the Ring during the holidays.  I have my wifi router very near the front door so have really good connection.

  I was shifting between giving the Ring Pro one star or five stars. My final answer is five stars with the following explanation and caveats. A stable working Ring Pro is an outstanding product. After over two months, three Ring Pro Doorbells, lengthy email and phone interactions with costumer service, I feel comfortable putting to pen the following which will hopefully not only help the consumer but also the company:<br><br>*  The sine qua non of a stable and functioning Ring Pro unit is adequate voltage [amperage seems to be a non-issue]. The Elk-TRG2440 transformer is ideal. Ring® is just beginning to acknowledge this since Ring® “will work on providing even more transparency to our customers as we can in the future.” There is also evidence that inadequate/low voltage will actually break the unit, so address this issue first.<br><br>*  “Rewiring” your house is not necessary. If your “old” wiring is handling say 12 volts, then it will handle 24 volts.<br><br>*  The Ring® Pro Power Cable, when used as an isolated fix is not necessary and in fact is most likely to be a useless and avoidable troubleshooting step. There is no need to bypass your original chime if you simply use the appropriate voltage at the start of this project.<br><br>*  As of this writing, DO NOT DEPEND ON THE VOLTAGE READING FROM THE “Device Health”, as the reading will fluctuate from “very poor” to ""very good"" to “4376 mV” independent of actual voltage measured with a volt meter. Purchase or borrow a voltage meter. An inexpensive one will do just fine.<br><br>*  Although customer service at Ring is pleasant to talk to and email, you may soon realize that you are drilling for oil on a city street in terms of obtaining meaningful help. Amazon, not Ring, provided superior service (replacing the non-functioning unit) two months after purchase.

  I would have bought a Zmodo door bell, because you have to pay to see history of who was at the door. Zmodo does it for free and the doorbell is cheaper. Ring should change their policy on subscription service and give you a 15 seconds of viewing like Zmodo. I'm not paying $3/month for a 15 second check who was at the door.<br><br>Otherwise the doorbell works and wasn't too bad to install, had to send back for a replacement although because the 1st one didn't work but the tech was helpful enough.

  Purchased this as a gift for my in-laws.  I develop software and hardware.  I double and triple checked to make sure everything was setup correctly.  I checked the line at the doorbell and it was at ~18.5v.  The doorbell won't power on.  Reddit suggested waiting 24 hours, as some eventually powered on.  It's been 48 hours and the doorbell still won't boot or show signs of life.  I've been trying to get through to their support team on the phone and can't get to a live agent.  If they can't resolve the issue or replace the item, I'll update my review to one star and return the device and get them something that works.

  We recently moved into a new house.  Being the chronic DIY guy I thought I'd do something other than the typical doorbell.  After much research I decided on the Ring Pro.

I like this since we live int he country because I can monitor who comes and goes.<br><br>Very convenient options and setup.  Overall after over 2 weeks the system has worked well.  Excellent product and not too bad a price.

  Fairly easy to install with the excellent instructions included. Appears to work very well and as advertised. Costs $30 a year extra to have your videos stored.<br><br>Update (June 2018): Found a serious flaw with the Ring App installed on a Samsung Galaxy S8 - when the App is activated it immediately silences the ringtone (one has to go to S8 settings and 'unsilence' the ringtone).

  This is a pretty sweet doorbell. You can create custom motion detection.  The quality is great and it wasn’t too hard to install. My only issue is from time to time the video feed pixelates but I have a feeling it is my cellular signal. I have 80meg down and 20meg up  DSL so I do not believe the doorbell is at fault. It records motion and notifies you within seconds of motion and when somebody rings your doorbell. It’s just an awesome product

  The marketing says ""easy to install,"" which since I've done electrical work (successfully) before like installing a sub-panel I thought this would not be a problem.  I was wrong.

  Ring Video Doorbell Pro was easy to install (as long as your a little handy as a do it yourself person). The installation app made setup a breeze.

I told him I would be home in five minutes.<br><br>It was very easy to install even though mine had a buzzing sound when I first put it in. I replaced the transformer in my closet, but it turns out I didn't need to. I had simply compressed the wires too hard at the front door. When I took the bell off and repositioned it, my Ring worked perfectly! I highly recommend it. It's one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.<br><br>I  also have a dog who used to go ballistic when the doorbell would ring.

  This was a serious purchase for me and I have used it long enough to know I want it around permanently. It was easy for me to install, and the one glitch I ran into was graciously resolved by the helpline person, who actually knew EXACTLY what I was talking about. I bought this model rather than the original because of the narrow mounting space by my door. It does seem a little pricey, but in this case you get what you pay for. I am now contemplating additional Ring products.

  Purchased due to volume of packages we receive weekly and an uptick in petty theft in the neighborhood.  Installation was easy, and well documented on the product website; addition of a circuit to the doorbell transformer (two wires), replace the current doorbell with the Ring Pro (two wires) and then link to home network.  Just be sure to adjust the size of the motion window on the app, unless you desire alerts when a car drives down the street.

  I am extremely happy with RING. So glad I bought. It picks up the smallest night creature -- as well as my own pets if I need to watch them while they are in the front of the house. Also like the windchine sound it makes since I am a windchime lover.  I bought on Prime Day and got a good deal on it. Comforting to be away from home and get alerted if someone is near the house, etc.

  I live on a busy street and wanted a little more peace of mind. The Ring Video Doorbell Pro has provided that and then some. I originally purchased this because I wanted to have the basic video and two way audio communication from my doorbell, while at home. I was also intrigued by the convenience of it ringing to my phone. Even if I am outside in the back yard, I know when someone is at my door. Installation was a piece of cake. The video instructions within the Ring App do a fantastic job of walking you through the entire process. When I first got this, I hadn't thought much about the cloud recording option, or the remote access features. Since installing it, I have tried out the recording and remote communication. It is simple and provides excellent quality. There is an interface within the app to define a particular field of view for the motion sensing features. You can also fine tune the motion sensitivity so that it doesn't trigger every time the wind blows. Once I got mine dialed in, I get notifications for activity on my property, but not for every car or person passing by. Depending on your location, the settings may vary a lot, and I think its great to have so much flexibility of the adjustments. Multiple phones can communicate with the doorbell at the same time which is neat. I used to miss visitors a lot because I couldn't hear my original chime. Now I never miss a visitor, whether I am home or away. The notifications are great, and it is very easy to view or share any recorded events. Exporting and deleting video is very easy. It does what it says it can do, and it does it well. So far I am very impressed with the quality and features.

  If you have a standard old house, then this doorbell works great. The issue I had is my house is so new that I have a digital doorbell, also I did not have doorbell wire but instead cat-6 wire. (I know weird...) I recently learned though after buying this that it only works for DC homes, not AC homes. This means I had to spend 2 weeks researching which parts I needed for this doorbell to work. I needed a new doorbell chime, as well as transformer. But after this hump, it works like a champ.<br><br>Bottom line:<br>Research your houses doorbell system and understand what you are doing.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Would recommend but there are a couple things they need to improve,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2017","<span>
  It was easy to set up and the instructions were very good. My only issue is I show I have excellent network connection to the unit but it does drop the connection quite  bit. The second item is the volume at the doorbell is not clear nor loud enough.  There needs to be a way to up the volume on the doorbell unit. It has a decent picture even in pretty dark settings. The daytime picture is excellent. One useful thing I have found is to use the motion detection to give me advance notice so that I can answer much quicker. I have set the unit up that when someone pushes the doorbell button my smart home hub will turn on the outside porch light after sunset. I would give it a 5 star rating if the volume at the unit was adjustable and the voice quality was better.

  I'm using two Ring doorbell pros, a solar stickup and a floodlight cam. All have good video both day and night and are easy to setup. Good features in the Apple app and it works well especially the neighborhood feature. The Alexa Show skill for Ring also a big plus. I did upgrade my transformer for the extra current for two doorbells. I hope Ring can develop a carriage light camera for either side of the garage door as the Kuna camera video at night is extremely poor! I didn't realize the feral cats that are around but maybe they help keep the mice population down. Ring is an ideal solution for the DIY homeowner.

  Really like the product, but install was rough.  You need a 24v transformer and you need to ensure your chime kit is compatible.  Had a 16v trans, which is supported, and it did not work.  Upped to a 24 but then my chime kit would ring randomly(in the middle of the nite!).  Bought a new supported chime kite and the same thing happened.  Ring support has been great and responsive and sent me free accessories to bypass the chime kit.  Now my family loves it.  Just be sure all your existing components are compatible,

4.0 out of 5 stars,Angle brackets too flimsey,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2020","<span>
  Overall the ring is very good - works as expected; except, the angle brackets are made of such flimsy plastic that the screws to hold them to the wall break through the material. Also the screws that hold the ring to the bracket are so small that the threads in the bracket get stripped easily. I had to use washers on the bracket to prevent the screw from going through the hole. I couldn't do anything about the stripped threads but just be gentle and hope it holds. Maybe they should be made of metal.

  This is an excellent product. I live in a multi-story house, so this innovation allows me to see and talk to the door without traveling the stairs. The installation is straightforward and easily achieved in most any home. Because I used this video doorbell to replace an older intercom system, I also needed to purchase the ring doorbell chimes, which also work very well. The daytime video picture is very good, and the night time video picture is good. It is a blend of increased security, and enhanced convenience at a very reasonable price point.<br><br>My biggest disappointment lies in the inability to increase the volume on the speaker at the door. The sound projection to those at the door is quieter than I would like it to be. If there were some volume control to increase sound for those at my door I would have given this product 5 stars.<br><br>The optional cloud recording service is a good feature and value, however in my particular circumstance, it is unnecessary. The features the video doorbell offers meet my needs without cloud recording. However, I can see how others with different circumstances would appreciate this optional service.<br><br>I can recommend this product to any household. It will allow you to answer your door using your smartphone from wherever you are. The window badge included in the package also serves as another tool for deterrent to wrongdoers, advising anyone at your door that motion-activated monitoring by sound and video is underway after approaching your door.  It is a product which helps any home get better and safer when installed.

   The product performs as described. My wife and I are seniors. Though we live in a low crime area, we were always concerned that we had to open the door to see who rang the bell. Mostly it was door to door solicitors. However the unease was always there. On the upside, the Ring Pro has eliminated that concern. I can continue to watch my poor Bears stink up the NFL while dismissing a contractor who has this special deal for me ""because he was in the area doing work for my neighbors!""<br><br>However, frequent use has shown some of the shortcomings. One is the inability to adjust the pitch and yaw (up &amp; down, side to side). It would be nice, especially during this holiday season with packages arriving almost daily, to be able to pitch the camera forward so we could see more of the apron in front of the door.<br><br>Second, the view to the left of our Ring Pro is partially obscured by the edges of  brick wall of the house.  A yaw adjustment to allow the Ring Pro to be turned slightly during installation would eliminate that annoying obstruction.<br><br>Lastly, smaller is always better!<br><br>All in all, a fine product. We also have the larger model on our patio door. It allows us to monitor the antics of our Labrador Retriever on these frigid days when we can no longer take her for walks. Also minimizes the chances she will be out too long.<br><br>If I could figure out how to get a video from my phone to my laptop, I could show you what I mean.<br><br>All in all, a fine product.

  I am not impressed with Ring. The camera gets distorted when people are up close. I've use other brands with much better success. Also, you have to have a paid subscription to view anything past live feed. Other brands offer free recording with playback. If you don't catch the motion detected immediately, you are unable to view past events even though it list motion detected 5, 10, 30 40 times. I would not recommend this product unless you plan on paying for a subscription.

  It works Ok I guess. Bur not all that great considering the lofty price. Even more, they conveniently set the free subscription time longer than the return window. So, by the time you realize it is a worthless piece of crap without the subscription, you can't return it.<br><br>Bottom, line is: it doesn't do anything of value without paying a monthly fee. I assumed it would still function without the monthly fee. As in, they would let you see your event for 24hrs or so. But no. If you don't look at the event within a few seconds, it won't let you see it without a subscription. That's just horrible.

Also most of the time the doorbell does not activate my indoor bell so we don’t know anybody is at the door unless they knock or my phone is near me.

  I have tried for months to get in touch with these guys. The Ring app works fine if you just want to check on things (for the most part), but if the motion sensor goes off or someone rings the doorbell, the app freezes and becomes totally useless. You can close the app and open it back up after you’ve been robbed (10 minutes or so), and SOMETIMES it may have video. I have been to the website and tried all troubleshooting they suggest. WiFi signal is well above what is required. I’m at a loss as to what to do next. I wasted a lot of money on something that was supposed to help me keep my family and belongings safe...

  Not only is this product really useful, functional and well-designed, but I found that the makers of this product designed great instructional help!  From installation, to connection, to use -- there's a short, clear video to help you out.  I was able to quickly and easily install the Ring doorbell, and had absolutely no frustration (like practically all other home maintenance jobs).  The videos are right on your phone as you're doing the install, and they address the questions you might have succinctly and simply.  These instructions are probably the best I've ever seen, and I've done LOTS of home maintenance projects.  Usually the worst part of these jobs is trying to decipher the sketchy instructions, and you end up having to make guesses and redo stuff.  Not the case with Ring.  So, the other great thing is that this is a really good products.  Started working instantly and the app is intuitive.  I love this thing.

  Works great.  Easy to install.  Even for someone who has absolutely no electrical experience I think.  Doorbell electrical wires are low voltage so you don't have to worry about shutting off power at the breaker.  The only thing I wish was a little better is the motion alerts.  I wish it did face recognition the way the nest products do because sometimes you get way to many alerts for things that aren't necessary.  It's still a great product though and it also has a better look than the nest doorbell does in my opinion.

  Alerts you to motion as well as ringing of the doorbell.  If you have a smart watch it goes to that too.  You can select the motion range to only the porch or as far out as the street.

Trying to get a warranty solution involves 30 minutes of your time, a computer, and your credit card.  Still waiting for a replacement to arrive so I can try and get this resolved.

The Android app must be held<br>vertically and will rotate for the camera either for previous or live views. However, when invoking any function the phone must be<br>held vertically. In setup mode the app invokes some Google-based mapping app that does not have half the addresses on my block. When I put in my address then saw it confirmed in the list below and selected it, the App inputs either of my next door neighbors addresses. The App leaves me NO way to associate my real address with any of the Ring devices. Even though the Device Health of my doorbell shows an RSSI of 47 (which is Good by any standard), 30% of the time it takes my 2 tries to get a Live View because the first attempt says my Android phone is having trouble reaching my doorbell. By the way, my RSSI fluctuates between 42 and 47 (that's normal).<br><br>In moving to my iPad I note that Ring App, although written to run under iOS, looks very much the same as the App on Android, similar look and feel. However, I often use the iPad from a horizontal position. The Ring app if invoked from a horizontal position will initially<br>show all screens in the Horizon position. When I turn the iPad vertically, the screens automatically rotate (like they should). I can then<br>select my doorbell device and invoke recent activity. If I ask to see motion the camera shows the movie horizontally. When I end it the<br>prior screen comes back sideways. However, unlike the Android phone, I can then physically turn my iPad vertically and then horizontally<br>and the screen reverts back to horizontal. Invoking live view from a horizontal position shows the camera in that position. If<br>I then turn the iPad vertically, the camera rotates to vertical. The Android will not do that. Ending live view puts the previous screen<br>sideways and I have to physically turn my iPad twice to get the screen in horizontal sync. Unlike the Android, I can change my address<br>by selecting the device and then its setting and then selecting change location. The mapping app called has my address! The iPad is the<br>most functional platform for the Ring App.<br><br>In using the Windows 10 Laptop I note that Ring app looks different. The Home screen allows me to select the Device such as my doorbell<br>select its settings and change my address. The map invoked finds my address. Furthermore, there is an explicit save button to save my new address. Also, saving a video to an MP4 is snap. Since I have a larger screen on the laptop the videos are clearer. On the downside, I see NO WAY to invoke a live view to the camera. I can click on the live view column and see live views that were saved (and invoked from some other platform), but I see no way to invoke a new live view. It should be noted that on the laptop I use, screen rotation is not an issue. I do have a Microsoft Surface and I have not tried it on that machine yet.<br><br>Administrative Issues<br><br>I had previously ordered and installed a regular Ring Doorbell on December 31, 2016. I was dissatisfied with the battery powered model<br>and 10 days later, on January 10, 2017 I installed a Ring Pro. Upon installing the first doorbell I prepaid $ 30 for annual cloud service.<br>On the 10th I decommissioned the Ring and used the Ring App to remove the Ring and add a new device, namely the Ring Pro.<br><br>Now the App wants me to purchase cloud services, yet the App shows me having paid the annual fee. On all the platforms I'm asked to<br>select either the trial, pay monthly or annually. There is no way to transfer my prepayment to the new device. It would be nice if this<br>were an option.<br><br>Wifi Issues<br><br>If you are getting a Ring or Ring Pro it appears imperative that you purchase a Wifi extender. I did when I ordered the first Ring.<br>I then installed it some 30 feet approximately from the doorbell. Periodically I received notice of poor signal strength and live views<br>did not work. So I moved the extender to about 20 feet from the doorbell and performance improved. Then a day later I moved the<br>extender to within 7 feet of the doorbell and signal quality ranged between RSSI of 42 to 47.<br><br>As far as upload speeds, you need at least 1Mbps, however previous documents indicated a minimum upload speed of 2Mbps. My upload<br>speed is 34.8Mbps and downloads are 40.2Mbps. So I meet the minimums easily.<br><br>In Summary<br><br>It is imperative that you read every document you can on the website. There seems to be new ones added daily. My Ring Pro was installed<br>directly to a 24v transformer. I purchased all the parts recommended by Ring: the transformer, WiFi extender, and wire. I saw the installation videos and felt comfortable installing the doorbells. That part was a breeze because I had all the parts needed when I began the<br>install that lasted maybe 15 minutes?<br><br>The only issue I have is that the motion settings need a lot more explanation and show and tell. I've reset the motion settings<br>multiple times. These setting are extremely sensitive. At one point I was being notified every time a car came down the street.<br>So I moved the boundaries back, then every stranger walking down the sidewalk tripped a notification. So I reduced the boundaries again<br>and moved them back.<br><br>I finally got the boundaries the way I wanted them. What I learned was that it was impossible to use my Android phone to draw them. The<br>picture screen was too small and the captions intruded on the area I needed to draw. The Windows 10 laptop had no way for me to redraw<br>the boundaries, and there was no way to delete a zone and recreate a new one. The laptop version was useless, furthermore, there was<br>absolutely no guidance. The only platform that worked for this purpose was my iPad. I could tap the existing diagram, reshape it to my<br>liking and save it without any issues.<br><br>In fact, I would have been very frustrated with this entire setup process if I could not use my iPad.

  Very easy to set up however it did not immediately connect to my router. Just had to unplug the router for a couple of minutes and when I plugged it back in it connected with no problem. Daytime image is a little pixelated but I suspect it is due to my Ring being mounted nearly flush against an adjacent wall. This is just the design of my front porch. Picture is otherwise very good and am really considering ordering the other outdoor cameras that are offered by Ring. Just installed the Ring today but so far am very happy.

  I purchased the Ring Pro for the UK market and therefore received the Euro package that includes a 24VAC transformer and a Ring Chime. The system hardware installation is straightforward and configuration set up following the iOS app step by step guide is very clear. Ring also sell corner and wedge kits to angle the door bell as per the photo since in this case the door bell is some distance from the door centre line. With around 40Mbs download and 10Mbs upload wifi speeds, notifications to iOS devices is practically instant on the same wifi and I'd estimate 2-3 second lag if the iOS is on a slower 6Mbps mobile phone network. The linked Ring Chime rings immediately and can be configured to have different sounds for bell push or motion detection. The volume can also be adjusted but unfortunately not independently for bell push and motion. The live view or captured video quality could be improved since there is a loss of resolution and also has some visual artefacts, I suspect due to the compressed files. It is possible to read a vehicle registration number plate 5 metres from the Ring Pro. Recorded videos are automatically saved by Ring under the 30 day trial and can be viewed, shared or downloaded via the iOS app or a Ring website seconds after capturing. The audio feature doesn't have the loudest speaker nor the most sensitive microphone but is just about adequate.<br>There are some minor issues such as very occasional false motion detections maybe caused by interference or electrical spikes since those videos have obvious strange pixelation and some iOS app issues that can easily be addressed with firmware updates. The screws for the corner kit were also the wrong size.  However, saying that, the Ring Pro is fundamentally well designed and made.<br><br>Positives<br>- Build quality<br>- Motion detection area configuration<br>- Customer support that is second to none<br>Negatives<br>- Loss of resolution likely due to compressed video visual artefacts; this unfortunately drops a review star rating.<br>- The odd false motion detections<br>- Some minor iOS app bugs

I have researched this problem and it is a major problem for many people.  I have tried to isolate the network, used both 2,4 and 5.2 bands but neither solves the problem.  I have strong signal strength at the unit so contrary to what the support people tell me this is NOT the problem.  I am very disappointed I cannot find a fix to this problem.

  I started out with the standard Ring doorbell.  I liked it a lot and was impressed with the battery life.  I installed it with Velcro until I made a decision on where to mount it.  It was too wide to mount right next to my door.  I then researched the Pro model and found that it was narrow enough to mount it in place of the existing door bell.  I returned the standard with a full refund and purchased the Pro.  I installed it and needed a little help with a firmware update.  I called the support line and left my info for them to call me back.  They did within an hour and got everything working for me.  I am now experimenting with the security zone and sensitivity to set it up for our needs.  I opted to subscribe to the cloud recording just in case I needed a video of someone at the door.  You never know these days what can happen.  I am very pleased with the product and support that Ring provided.

Ring answered my call and spent more than an hour troubleshooting with me.  I’m extremely grateful and I got it installed.  We feel so much more linked in with our home when we’re away.  My only issue is that the motion detector at night picks up headlights and sends me alerts late when we are asleep.

It is a great advancement to the doorbell.  I've already used it with a delivery man and my neighbor, when I wasn't home and it's only been two-weeks.

  I like the door bell a lot! Had a little trouble setting up, not because of the bell, but because my internet provider AT&amp;T upload speed was not sufficient to operate it. Change to Comcast and had no problems, after Ring and I found that I need the relay or chime to boost signal to the second floor. I have a condo with a private entrance. Mounted chime on opposite wall behind door-bell-camera. Ring people will work with you. The videos on the Amazon site were a great help, since the bell they sent me, the instructions were in French!

  It seems to be reliable about 85% of the time. The recommended mbs of speed were not enough to produce a clean video, it was very choppy. Because of this, I ended up installing a wireless router within about 15' of the doorbell so it could get a better signal. Now I can consistently speed test between 15-30mb at the door so the video is always crisp. We tend to get several false movement notifications during the day but I have the sensitivity all the way up. I would rather have some false movements than to miss something because it didn't go off. Overall, I am happy with it and plan to add the ring video sticks around the exterior of the house.

  Agree wholehartedly with ""Ring Pro: A Company That Breaks Itself On a Regular Basis"" Spent way too much time with ""excited"" support reps who ask me to do the same speed tests and diagnostics over and over again with the same result. That I have plenty of speed and signal but the device rarely can record video without major freezes. A friend of mine has the same experience as apparently do many others. If you want to confirm that your infrastructure is not the problem run a traceroute. in your windows start/search box type cmd, then click command prompt, then in the black box that comes up paste or type "" tracert -d (enter the ring website here with the www ring com since amazon wont allow urls) "" without the quotes. If you see the first several computers your trace hits have &lt;30ms latency then you see requests timing out when you hit computers with addresses that start with 54.239 and 52.6 many combinations of AWS computers that is what is causing the issue.<br><br>Then you need to send them this info and tell them to stop wasting your time and fix their own issue with their hosting service. They want you to sign up for a monthly cloud subscription but cant get sufficient bandwidth to encode and serve a very muddy &lt;600kb stream of 1080 video which is extremely bad encoding quality. They call it 1080HD video which it is at 1080 but encoding it at this low of a rate is terrible. It is giving you a 30 second clip of video in the file size of a single standard cellphone photo. I assume they dropped the encoding quality to make up for the bandwidth problems they are having at the host.

  Install was easy. Took 36 hours before it had the power to run although tech support said it would take up to 1 hour. Biggest problem is that it doesn't record before the motion. Oftentimes it would signal motion but the camera showed someone walking away. Other times we would get a notification with nothing on video and open the door to a package that was left. Works fine with the Echo Show but delay is too long to be of use. We are going to try the Skybell that claims to record 3 seconds before motion detection.

  Ordered the Ring Pro on Friday, delivered on Sunday and installed in 30 minutes (leveraging a digital chime with compatible transformer).  It was easy to install and set up.  The instructions are pretty straightforward and other than one hiccup with loss of wifi connectivity on initial setup, installation and set up went according to instructions.  So far (1 day) we are very pleased with Ring Pro.  Live View connectivity is fast (using an apple Airport Extreme).  Video quality is not what I expected, relatively grainy and therefore facial features in daylight are not clear (could be a case of oversold expectations because of claim of 1080Pm but small camera).  Motion detection is great.  We received a motion alert when a dog ran through our custom motion detect area (~15 feet from camera) and could hear the gist of the conversation of the dog owners walking on the side walk (~20 feet from ring).  Overall would recommend this product and will update review once we have more experience with it.

  Hardware installation was surprisingly easy. I had this installed and uninstalled in 10 minutes total time. The software setup process was challenging.<br><br>The setup steps seemed simple enough but in order to complete setup the signal to the router needs to be incredibly strong. My doorbell was about 50 feet from the wifi router and showed ""yellow"" bars in the Ring app but that wasn't enough to successfully complete setup. I had to move the router right next to the door for it to work. The process of failing setup was extremely painful and required me to delete and re-add the doorbell multiple times and the process was counter to the actual steps communicated by the app.<br><br>Once I got the device connected I learned that the recommended mounting height of 48 inches was okay but not great for actually capturing visitors at the door. Additionally the video quality was challenged by the difference in exposure/lighting between my covered porch and the bright sun illuminating the background. The result was an incredibly grainy image and, if there was a problem where I needed to use the image captured by the Ring doorbell to identify someone, I would not have been able to.<br><br>Finally, my door frame is quite wide. The natural place for the doorbell, and where it was originally wired to, is about two feet away from the door knob itself. Thus there was a clear dead zone created where someone could be knocking on the door with no clear, immediate view of them and would require me to use the DVR features to go back and watch them walk up to the porch.<br><br>And so I learned that uninstalling this device and sending it back was actually incredibly easy and clear.

   Let’s give this its due: an ingenious invention that’s disrupted an entire category and made homeowners a lot safer. That doesn’t mean installation is guaranteed to be without hiccups – we are talking about a pared-down version of a security camera here, tied to your doorbell no less. So if you go into it expecting some minor complexities you won’t get irrational on yourself, your family and Ring customer service.  In our case, our doorbell was mechanical variety and we discovered lacked sufficient voltage to deliver a full ring after connecting the system.  We called customer service – they are open 24 hours – and both people we spoke to were knowledgeable and patient.  They sent us a free power cord and additional chime  which arrived about two days.  In the interim, we were still able to use the system, just not get a full doorbell ring.  Other than that, connected up to our Wi-Fi easily. (HINT: if you have a mesh network like Eero or Google Wi-Fi, turn off all points connected to your router  except the one closest to the door bell. Connect Ring to that WI-FI point, then turn back on the other points in the network around the house.) There are a number of settings to customize both view, sensitivity, alerts and so forth. Just explore what's best for you. There's also a very handy feature where you can upload videos directly from the app to your Ring neighborhood group. If you don't recognize someone or have an incident, it's a great crowdsource safety feature. You can also check out your neighbors' videos to stay up on the latest snoopy solicitor or package pincher. I finally got a first-hand look at why so many of my shipped items have been arriving broken - check out my video to see for yourself!  Don’t forget to turn your sound up :-)

  This device is an excellent functional security device. The kit comes with everything needed to install it yourself plus four different colored case covers to choose from. It's easy to install. The instructions were clear and easy to follow and the doorbell and chime were easy to connect to my wifi. The only reason that I'm not rating this product as a 5-star is that the volume is too low on the device which makes it hard for a visitor to hear you speaking to them especially if you live on a busy street. You also have to call the company to have them adjust the volume instead of being able to do it yourself. Otherwise a worthwhile investment which allows a clear picture and real-time feed of who's at your door whether you or home or not. For example,  I was able to talk to the FedEx delivery guy and tell him where to leave my package even though I was not home at the time. Very glad I purchased this product!

  Installed a year ago. Worked great. Really loved it. During the recent package bombings in Austin I went to show a friend the live view from my front door and realized the doorbell wasn't working anymore. Perfect time for no security! After troubleshooting I found that the power pro module which connects the Ring to your actual hallway doorbell had come apart for no obvious reason other than shoddy manufacturing. Customer support was terrible. Multiple chat sessions and email exchanges resulted finally in getting the wrong size replacement part. Now after trying to get that corrected I've finally given up and am looking for another brand's video doorbell. Bad customer support plus poor manufacturing make Ring a poor choice.

  The installation was very easy. I have a traditional door button/bell connected to a mechanical door chime.<br>The iPhone app is less appealing.  1. It sometimes disconnects from my network.  2. It provides a sound when motion is detected but the camera screen doesn't just pop open.  I have to go into the app. 3.  A message stays on the bottom of the screen saying that I have 30 days to decide if I want to store my videos in the cloud.  4. The ""keep Your Ring Videos"" screen has no link to your website.  5. Your help icon is not obviously for help.  I thought it was for making a comment.

  I really like the way this device works.  Very easy to install with just a few basic tools.  I had to buy the Zinc Alloy Doorbell Angle Adjustment Adapter, which added to the cost, but it was worth it to me.  I like this version of the Ring Doorbell because it is powered by the existing doorbell wiring and doesn't require charging any batteries.

(There are capacitors that need to build up) As I found out by working with the customer service /tech support department on a Sunday! The support provide is outstanding. Being an IT person I really tried to figure out why the system worked at first then kind of started not providing a clear picture (I just needed to wait until the system had enough charge) which by the time I finished working with support it did. To put icing on the cake, unbeknownst to me my WiFi started to have issues 3 days later, once again tech support to the rescue as they figured that part out. As the saying goes a happy wife means a happy life! I now have a very Happy Wife! Ring.com is everything that it says it is and the Ring Pro is too!

  Easy to set up as we had a hard-wired doorbell already.  It works as advertised and provides a great sense of security, especially when no one is home.  People who come to the door either leave right away or snap into very good behavior once they notice the Ring. We are about to buy the Ring camera/floodlight for the other side of the house.

  I love the peace of mind this gives me when I'm away.  Installation was quick and easy and I had the doorbell installed and set up in about 20 minutes.  While testing the unit I discovered the audio did not work.  I contacted Customer Support on a Friday night.  They were very easy to deal with.  Unfortunately, they determined the unit I bought was defective.  They shipped me a new unit which, arrived the following Tuesday.  The new unit functions fine.  My only complaint is the quality of the video at night.  While decent, it is not the quality I expected.  This is particularly true if the person outside is not standing perfectly still.  All in all I would purchase this again and would recommend it to my friends.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Ok doorbell and security camera.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2017","<span>
  So far it works very well. Camera has good resolution and night mode is pretty cool and effective. Only thing knocking it back a star is the lack of local network storage option and the need to sign up for the cloud service to continue getting access to on demand past videos<br>UPDATE - I downgraded it to 1 star. I am not able to change the wifi to my faster Network (5Ghz) and the doorbell chime almost never works. When I connect to the doorbell and attempt to speak to someone at the door the video stream locks up and is not interactive. So it does pretty much nothing I bought it for aside from sending alerts that there is someone at my door. Likely going to buy the Nest doorbell instead but will try Ring support to see if they can help get it working.

  Ring gives clear panoramic views out your door during the day and reasonably clear pictures even at night.  Control over motion detection sensitivity allows you to monitor everything that moves (including leaves and squirrels) or just people.

  Let me start out by saying I am a techno geek who tries everything.  I have a house wired with 7 security cameras (5 are wireless) and a whole Nexia system which runs my lamps, blinds, etc.  I have 2 routers AND a repeater, so I am intimately familiar with setup of devices and wireless signals.<br>  I've had nothing but troubles with the video of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  I also had an issue with notifications.  My first support call involved the technician spending 30 minutes walking me through things I had already done and ending with him telling me they had a server problem that was probably the cause!  The second call today was because I was no longer able to see ANY video.  The tech I talked to was good and informed me that they recommend  4Mbps up and down bandwidth, and my signal at the bell was too slow.  I replaced the router which was acting up and got my speeds to 15X the recommended speeds and guess what? - Still no video!  What good is a video doorbell if it doesn't work?  If you are looking at this you should wait until they work the issues out.  One thing you should be aware of is that this is not a standalone doorbell.  It requires a connection to their server in order to work.  I guess it should be no surprise there are server issues when they keep advertising these and pumping them out with problems.

  Received this at 530pm, it was starting to get dark...  Had it installed and working by 6:15..  Simple to set up, easy to use the software, had it connected to Echo Show really fast.  It took 15' longer because the bell wire from the transformer to the doorbell was too thin.  While I love the square wire pulg given for connecting wires, the high gauge (tiny diameter) bell wire from the transformer was so thin that it could not be pushed into the provided connector.  So I had to twist and solder the wires together and cover with wire nut /tape.  Need to include small wire nuts for this in addition or separate from the block connectors.  Also, oddly enough I found that paying for the service add-on was a lot more trouble to click through than is should have been.

Placed an new order for a new Ring pro and chime when it came in plug it to the 16 volt transformer and nothing, then plugged it in the the 24 volts transformer and it came to life.  It's been running for the last few days so I'm hoping for the best because I like this little gadget.

  I’ve only had my doorbell installed for about a week. So far I love it! It was pretty easy installation overall. My only problem was I originally had a faulty doorbell. Getting help from tech support was a nightmare. They make you jump through hoops, emailing a questionnaire with pictures, calling back to be on hold again, gave incorrect advice. Then after a few days they finally said they would send me a new one. It took weeks to get here!! (I should have just returned it to the place I purchased it, would have been so much faster!)<br>However, now that it’s installed and working, it’s great!

  Fantastic.  I've had the regular version and uninstalled it multiple times for neighbors.  Both work just fine.  I needed the pro as the trim around my door is smaller which wouldn't allow the regular version to be mounted.  Is the picture on this THAT much better than the regular?  No.  Don't expect the same picture as your cable TV.  Basically, choose which version will fit on your door trim and go with that one.  The motion features are basically the same even though on the PRO you can ""customize it.  I still get just as many false alerts.

  Two major complaints so far: 1) Very long delay between ringing the button from the outside and for your original chime to ring inside (like a 2-3 second gap). Tech support was totally unhelpful in addressing this issue, saying this is expected. Huh? Seems like an easy fix. Ring the internal chime before trying to connect to the cloud. 2) No local video recording option. You have to pay for a cloud service to get access to the video, which is so wasteful. It's not just the monetary cost, it's also a cost on your network bandwidth for uploading video and the expansion of your carbon footprint used by cloud computing resources to store the video, play the video, etc.

  Horse doody, there are extra fees involved of $3 a month even if you want to view current rings, unless you can somehow type your phone pin and get the app opened before the video is archived which I find extremely rare.  I liked the idea of this, but in actual usage there are a LOT of problems.  The fact Ring considers a current ring an existing event (which requires a subscription) is just a terrible experience.  Basically without the subscription this is useless, contrary to their posted documentation below. Ring should allow you to view Rings that are within a 3 minute window which would be the customer friendly thing to do.  Alternatively they can fix the massive delay in the product with a firmware update.<br><br>Are there any additional fees involved?<br>All Ring devices will operate without an additional fee or subscription. You will receive alerts when visitors press your doorbell or trigger motion sensors in your device. You will also get live streaming video and two-way audio. There is, however, a Ring Protect Plan service that requires a small fee. Ring Protect Plus will allow you to record, download, play back, and email recordings of Ring videos. As an added bonus, having a Ring Protect Plus plan subscription also entitles you to a 10% discount on future Ring Purchases.

With your phone you can answer the doorbell and speak directly to the person. A nice safety feature as well if you're not at home, they won't know you're not at home necessarily!

  I just installed this doorbell and really like it; however, you need to know that with the pro you need at least 2 Mbps upload speed recommended for best streaming performance.  I had to change internet providers in order to make the Live View work.  I'll know more after using it for several months.  Several people I've mentioned that I've been installing the video doorbell pro said they hadn't heard of it.  I suggested that they take a look at this product at Ring.com.

  I purchased a Ring Pro rather than the regular battery operated version.  Took a little more effort than anticipated at first as my previous entry system (which rang to the home phone/TV for video  and which had not been working and was impossible to get repaired) had a 12V transformer and Ring requires  a 16V transformer  (found at Lowes with landscaping irrigation stuff) and my wireless had to be updated to increase the range -- but the Ring hardware is easy to install and the software is very user friendly and the result has been a significant improvement over the prior wired system.  The video camera and chime provide a clear image that can be easily accessed anywhere and provide an attractive, modern look.  Great product!

  We LOVE our Ring door bell.  My wife is too short to see through our door peep.  If we weren't expecting anyone she would be a bit anxious answering the door.  On top of that we receive a fair amount of packages that are typically left at our front door.  No more worry when answering the door, and now we can see when a package is delivered, and more importantly if someone decided to come up and steal our package!  On top of all of that, it was very easy to install, and being able to adjust the motion sensitivity, and the field of motion was great as it stopped us from being notified when a neighbor passed our home walking their dog.  Great product!!

It is a good product. What I didn't know (and this is why it is 4 stars) is if you live in a Stucco home there is a good chance the connection won't be good if the modem is far from the camera. Apparently Stucco's chicken wire acts as a metal door.  Just a thought. Know where your modem is located and make an educated guess if the reach is long enough.

I especially like the chimes when there is activity near my front door -- I now when my mailman stops by.  Two things that can be improved:  1.  Provide an angle kit so people don't need to buy an aftermarket one 2.  Provide free web recording for the activity

  It was Dead On Arrival. I had adequate voltage,  confirmed with multimeter. Wiring was done right. Confirmed it with ring support. They’re sending me an extra power cable and mechanical bell, even though I told them I had 18 volts to the back of the unit and the unit wasn’t powering on. Returning the unit as soon as I confirm that hasn’t fixed the problem.

  Was bit skeptical after reading some reviews. However I am fantastically surprised. I installed it myself have a mechanical Bell. It took me end to end 30 minutes flat. Works perfectly with motion detection, Bell answers and intercom. Night vision works great as well.

  Easy to set up. I did have an issue where my door bell was humming and would ring on it's own, but that was because the wires that connect to the doorbell we're shorting from touching. After getting that corrected, it has worked perfectly. Love the wide angle of the camera. It would be nice to have other settings for motion detection, other sounds, etc but those are just minor changes. Overall l couldn't be happier with it so far.

In low light (perhaps at night) the camera operates in black and white, but with adequate illumination, it is in color.  I noticed a bit of ""feedback"" when I bring my cell phone near the device, especially if I am trying to speak to the person at the front door.  The audio at the front door is a bit ""tinny"" but works well enough.  The Ring Chime  accessory required a phone call to get it working but is reliable now.

  Ring Video Doorbell Pro is exactly as advertised.  It of course will not prevent a break in of your house, however, it is likely to descourage someone from breaking in.  The ring and motion alerts are great, which allow you to see who is at your front door as well as to check on any package deliveries.  Time delay is minimal and probably even a little faster than I expected.  The HD video and wide angle lens is very good.  Installation was simple, especially after viewing several installation videos on Utube.  I installed the Ring app on our iPhones, iPads, and Windows 10 home computer, which is user friendly and easy to navigate.  Ring Video Doorbell Pro is a relative inexpensive way to add additional security for your family and home.  I would recommend this product.

  I love the product. Installation was extremely easy, the application features and neighborhood features are excellent. I was not fully clear on the ongoing cost. The cost is very reasonable so not a big deal. The application seems to run a tad bit slow on my iPhone 6S and I find that by the time the application loads, the real time event has already passed in most cases. Could be due to our friends at Apple slowing the phones down due to battery life so I'll address that and see where the application performance lands. I definitely would recommend your full Ring product line and will be adding new devices for other areas of my home. Nice product and great support!

  HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE THE STANDARD REVIEW: 1. You need to make sure you have decent internet and router. I purchased a new router just to make sure this worked and it does perfectly. At the door, it gets about 50MB download and 10MB upload. If you have the minimum, expect it to be a little weird at times. I recommend a nighthawk router from Netgear (I have the X4S). 2. The view is really pretty good. You can see from my picture that my doorbell is pretty far over. That is a window, then the door. So the view is really good from almost the corner of my entry way. NOW ON TO THE REGULAR REVIEW.I wanted some sort of outdoor camera and it came down to this and the NEST. This won for several reasons. First, it installs very cleanly and easily. Second, the cloud saving is perfect for pricing and stores for much longer than other cameras and plans. $30/yr vs $100/yr. I liked the Pro because of the small extras over the previous version. The install for power through existing doorbell is great, the face plates are a nice touch and the overall size and app features make it worth the extra $50. My wife and I both love the alerts and how to customize when we get them. I have been recommending them to all my friends.

One call to Ring had those components at my door within a couple of days - and clear installation instructions in my inbox.  When I did install the product, the Ring support staff were great.  Very helpful!<br>The product has only one quirk as far as I can tell after using it for several days.  When you first install the Ring Pro, it needs some time to ""warm up"".  In my case it needed 48 hours before it showed any sign of life!  I recommend that Ring WARN us unsuspecting users - that will greatly reduce calls to their support team . However they seem to have a large capable team and can handle the calls well.<br>The only thing about the Ring I do not like is the prospect of having to pay a subscription to store the video feed. I wish there was an option to do that myself.<br>Thanks for the great product  Ring!

The picture quality is perfect at 1080. Installation is easy for the average handyman. I would like to download the saved files to my own cloud but still working on that issue. If you are trying to decide between the Ring and the Ring Pro, go for the Pro, you get the best.

  The packaging is great, the interface is good, the hardware looks polished, and the name rings a bell.<br><br>One major, disastrous, product-breaking flaw: STUPIDLY POOR CONNECTIVITY.<br><br>A little background, I have a NETGEAR Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Triband router, it was a $300 router top of the line when I bought it, and still works flawlessly. I have a Google Home, 6 Chromecast Audios, 1 Chromecast Ultra, 2 Amazon Fire TVs, Nest and Nest Protects, Door Locks, Light Controls, all spread out around my house, from the front door to the backyard, and all have 5 bars connectivity. My smart home is seamless, each command executes responsively. My WiFi is FINE, and my Internet is consistently 125 Mbps / 10 Mbps up.<br><br>Then comes the Ring Pro.<br><br>I excitedly installed the product, followed the instructions (very easy).<br><br>Connecting to WiFi was an issue. An hour later, I finally got it to connect (leaving my front door open) to the 2.4 ghz band (thinking range and stability &gt; speed in this situation).<br><br>Try the live view, BLACK SCREEN. Try ringing the door bell, no notification.<br><br>Reconnect to the 5 ghz band, the live view came through but heavily pixelated.<br><br>Over the next 6 hours, I moved my routers in every which yoga position, closer to the Ring Pro 10 feet, past another wall, tried changing channels. Set QOS priority to highest. Each alteration required me to ""Reconnect"" to the Ring Pro, as this stupid device did not seem to wake up or periodically check for signals after a router reset.<br><br>But whenever I finally find a good spot and the connectivity picks up, it subsequently dies a few minutes later. At best I could get live view to work 50% of the time. The other half it's Ring Pro is OFFLINE, or another BLACK SCREEN.<br><br>Definitely the device, and possibly Ring's cloud servers, suffer from severe connectivity issues. The lack of modern day stream encoding and quality balancing is astounding. Rather than buffering up or down, this is either a 100% work or 100% fail approach, and most cases it fails behind a single closed wooden door.<br><br>I really hoped I could be one of the happy Ring Pro owners like the many reviews I've read here, but I have tried everything to no avail. It either works great, or it's completely broken, depending on its mood. Maybe I got a defective Pro, but reading about other's issues leads me to believe that this lies within systemic and design flaws than just poor QC.<br><br>The ""Wi-fi Test"" page in the App leads to a 4040 Not Found page, what a joke.<br><br>Perhaps the upcoming hardwired Elite may offer a better solution, and perhaps that's why it's coming out, at least a hardwired connection will work.

  I've been wanting a video doorbell for a long time. I researched all the available options and finally chose the Ring Video Doorbell Pro. I also got a Floodlight Camera for the deck out back. I particularly like the appearance of the Pro. It looks like a doorbell. The HD video quality is great on my Android phone or tablet. The video can be zoomed and panned which I wasn't expecting. I like that the saved recordings include 4 or 5 seconds before the motion was detected so you can see the whole event. The polygon motion detection zone is easy to customize and prevents false notifications from street traffic or trees blowing in the wind.

  Our front door is in a narrow covered entry way, so this is a less than ideal location for Ring, but it still works great for me. I've had it about a month now. I love it and so does my wife. In my job I am often 1 - 2 hours away. I get alerts when there is motion detected and can switch on the app quickly and see what's there. There is a couple second delay, but it's no big deal to me. I can turn on live view to see what the weather is like at home. It gives me peace of mind. I plan on buying a couple of the stick up cams with solar panels so I can see my back porch and more of the front of my home. My wife has already shown the videos to two of our neighbor friends and now they want one as well.

  I was very excited about the product when I got it. And installing the ring itself is actually, as advertised, very simple. The ring works as expected. I like every feature. The problem comes with the way ring works together with your existing doorbell. I had to change my old mechanical doorbell to an brand new electrical one and that's where the problem began. My doorbell rings every minute now as ring, apparently, sends small currents through the system for whatever reason (probably to charge itself). And to ""help"" the situation, it's all about  difference with rings expectation of voltage and new doorbell VA range. Now I had to disconnect my doorbell and use ring only until I either install some ""bypass"" wiring from ring, or come up with some other place how to make these two work together.

  Upon installation, old doorbell transformer burned out.  Should at least specify VA (power requirement) in product literature; maybe mark on device as customary for most electrical loads.  ""Old"" doorbell does not ring at time unit button is pushed; this creates an awkward delay in acknowledging doorbell ""ringers"".  Recording of captured videos apparently not possible except by paying money to Ring for this service; a local DVR like provided for most surveillance camera systems would be a benefit.

  What we enjoy about the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is the quality of the images that are produced.  Another aspect is that it was easy to install, and the operation is simple, rather intuitive in fact.  Another point is that this is all about real time, and can be monitored when one is away and out of town.  So much better than an alarm system that alerts the police department as response time can be much slower.  Capturing an intruder on video and being able to speak with them is superior and a better deterrent than an intruder not knowing that they are being observed and videoed.  The price is fair and the peace of mind is priceless.

  It's a great door bell. I have a couple of criticism points. The door bell is on my front porch, it's a little dark during the day and can not make out face like I would like too. Also, sometimes I connect to the door bell from cell phone the screen will form pixels and turns the screen green . It will take a while or several times going in and out of the Ring app to get a clear screen. I would then have to reset the Ring door bell to see if it was a bad connection. That gets frustrating.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product with  LOTS of ROOM for IMPROVEMENT!,13 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2016","<span>
  I debated whether the Ring Video Doorbell Pro really deserved 5-stars but in the end decided that it really met most of my expectations but still could be a lot better.  The review is to let you know that you may face a challenging installation but may very well be like me, reasonably happy with the performance in the end.  First, the camera is wide-angle, 100 degrees vertically, 160 degrees horizontally.  That means unless your entryway is low with an overhang, e.g., on a roofed porch or in a low archway, the device may see a lot of the sky.  Unless it's facing in a northerly direction, the sky may be very bright relative to the area of your front door at certain times of day, causing people close to the doorbell to sometimes be underexposed and extremely backlit.  What Ring products really need is software that detects moving objects in the picture and optimizes exposure to the moving object, relatively ignoring bright parts of the background that are further away.  Secondly, the claimed resolution may be HD 1080 for a non-moving object within a few feet of the fisheye lens in a well-lit situation.  But more than a few feet away, if the subject is dimly lit or appreciably moving, the resolution is not so great and can be blurry, especially at night illuminated by the infrared beams in the device.  Another general lament is the instructions for setting up the device take an Apple minimalist approach.  There is very little detail and you are often referred to videos.  Well, you just want to know one little thing and the videos are linear, each several minutes long, and must be watched from beginning to end.  And which of many videos has the answer?!  You can be left searching, searching the Ring web site for the right video.  This conundrum could be solved by offering a complete, detailed manual on setup and operation to download for those whose installation problems are more complex.  The PDF manuals that you can download are just PDF's of the minimalist ""guides"" that come with the product.  Ring's approach to only serving up minimalist answers is to include in the product literature the offer to have a Pro come to your house and complete the installation for you for only $50.  On installing, the first big hurdle you face is making sure that your doorbell transformer puts out the 16 to 24 v required by the Doorbell Pro.  My transformer was so old that its faceplate labeling was impossible to read until I actually took it down but when mounted in its location, the 10 v transformer actually put out 14 v.  No instructions on how to read AC transformer voltage or that free of load, a transformer can actually put out 4 v or more than its rating, etc.  After you hunt around to find an authentic 16 v transformer (my Home Depot only had one rated at ""10 to 16 v""; a straight up 8, 16, or 24 v one was found at Lowes), you have to be sure that your doorbell chime will take the increased voltage or you'll be buying (and mounting) a new chime or using only the Ring Wi-Fi Chime.  Installing the required supplementary Power Kit on your chime or using the extra wires and connectors provided to install the Doorbell at its location is predicated that there is space within the chime and space within the wall the doorbell is mounted on to accommodate the extra wiring.  It took quite a bit of wire bending to get the Power Kit mounted inside the chime without interfering with the chime mechanism or having the cover fall off.  The doorbell mount instructions say ""push the wires back into the hole in the wall.""  There is NO SPACE in the wall.  The doorbell cable must be rigidly mounted to a stud and occupies most of the space created by the hole penetrating the wall so if I had had to use the extra wires and connectors, I'd have had nowhere to put them.  My classic doorbell button had a slight hollow recessed space behind it's plate that accommodated the protruding wires but the Ring Doorbell makes no such allowance.  The mounting holes for the Doorbell Pro did not match the old holes on a BRICK wall.  That meant drilling new holes with the supplied drill bit.  Not so bad for the first hole but the second hole in a different brick took FOREVER either because the brick was baked harder or the supplied bit was failing after one hole.  Perhaps Ring should supply a better drill bit or anyone facing a similar brick veneer mounting problem might want to pick up a better masonry drill bit for themselves.  On Wi-Fi setup, I'd used both an Android phone and a Windows phone at the install location to check out Wi-Fi strength before purchase.  With the Ookla speed test, I could get 22 Mbps download, 6 or 7 Mbps upload.  Yet the first attempt at install of the Ring failed with a message ""unable to establish Wi-Fi connection"" and the suggestion to try moving my router closer or get a Wi-Fi extender.  I accidentally terminated a second install attempt whereupon the voice in the Doorbell Pro that's active during setup announced, ""Wi-Fi connection established.....""  Except for light exposure problems related to sky and low light situations and moving people, things have been excellent since the INSTALL triathlon.<br><br>The really good parts.  Motion activation works great.  In spite of the install warnings about network quality, within a second or two of a person entering the device's motion detection range, my Windows phone will get a notification of motion activation.  Pressing the doorbell also similarly quickly activates my phone or the Ring Wi-Fi Chime but there is strangely a multi-second delay until the classic mechanical chime rings after a doorbell press.  On a Windows phone (a Lumia 950 XL), it takes quite a few seconds to launch the Ring app, so if you're planning on quickly answering a doorbell press yourself, you might want to have the app loaded and just sitting in the background all the time.  On a Surface Pro 2 computer, the Ring app launches in a flash after clicking on a notification but most of us are more likely to be close to a phone rather than a computer when the doorbell rings.  So maybe Ring should have a really fast-launching applet just for answering the doorbell and talking rather than launching an app with the other 9 yards of setup and reconfiguration routines for all your Ring devices.<br><br>The customizable motion detection zones work pretty well, too.  Wish there were more drawing points to determine the shape of included or excluded zones.  Cars moving in excluded zones whose headlights shoot into active zones will trigger alerts.  So will sunlight reflected off shiny objects moving in inactive zones.  Flicking on bright interior lights within the house will also trigger the doorbell at night if you have windows opening onto the area(s) the doorbell camera is looking at.<br><br>But it's an eerie Jetsons' feeling to be walking through your house, your phone vibrates, you look towards the front door, and see the shadow of the UPS delivery person on the front door glass before they can even reach for the doorbell.  And the Ring Chime has taken up residence in a remote part of the house from which we could never hear our old mechanical chime before.  Great product after the install routine with hopes that someday they'll offer a version with a high-end drone-quality video cam (at an affordable price)!  But during the day, the video close to the cam is very good.  And since hardly anyone ever comes to our door at night except on Halloween, the just OK quality at night is easy to live with.<br><br>12/02/16 Update: Discovered that the RING Universal Windows app (works on Win10 phones, tablets, computers) is NOT as full-featured as the Android app (nor probably as the iOS version, too).  With the Android RING app, you have a general sensitivity control over the customizable detection zones that's not offered in the Windows app, you can create rules to exclude motion detection by time of day and day of week, plus access to info on Wi-Fi signal strength to the device, device health, etc.  Would be nice to see the same features available no matter whether using the iOS, Android, or Windows RING app.<br><br>12/07/16 Update: There is literally a night and day difference in motion detection sensitivity.  During the day when set on max sensitivity, the device detects me walking up and down my driveway about 45-50 feet away.  At night, the detection sensitivity seems to be limited by the infrared beam output by the device to a distance of 10-15 feet (in both cases I'm bundled up in thermally insulated clothing that probably hides my own infrared output quite a bit).<br><br>As others have noted the quality of the audio output isn't fantastic and seems to depend a lot on the device you're using.  My wife on her iPhone 6 has no trouble understanding me and comes through the device's speaker pretty clearly.  The audio didn't sound as good at either end when using my Windows Phone (Lumia 950 XL).  Quite often in playing cloud-recorded video back using the Windows 10 app, the audio is not synchronized with the video but that may be the fault of the Win10 app or Ring's cloud service and not the device per se.  The audio sensitivity of the microphone is pretty good and can pick up the plop of the newspaper thrown by the delivery person from his car landing 45 feet away on our driveway or a neighbor talking loudly with a handyman 60 or 70 feet away.

  I very rarely have time to write a review but I felt that Ring deserved it.  Ring was recommended to us by another couple with children and they said how useful it was and how easy it was to install.  And it actually was.  I couldn't believe how even the Pro version (that had to be hardwired) that I chose installed like a charm just by me going step-by-step -and we have a Sears doorbell from 1968!  They really did make it so easy to install, set-up, and actually use through the App.  We are 101% happy with this purchase.  It's a very reasonable price to keep our home and kids (and deliveries) even more safe.  And our kids had a ball with it for days!

  This ring is working amazing! I had the original ring doorbell before and the connection sucked. The WiFi was terrible and the ring chime pro made things much worse. I purchased a netgear WiFi extender with this doorbell to expand my 5G network and now it’s super fast. The camera quality is amazing! The Echo Show 5 works well but my only complaint is that the picture quality with using ring on it is not the best but it does clear up.

  I waited to review until we had used it a month.  Works amazingly well..... sooo nice to be able to tell solicitors to go away and not have to appear at the door.<br>Package theft is bad in my area too, so when something gets delivered (and they never ring the door bell) I always know due to motion detection.  If I'm away, I can get a neighbor to grab it for us.<br>Ours is a brick house, and the internet is on the second level above the front door, we haven't had any problem with the connection.  I want to add driveway cameras, but I'm afraid they might not get a great signal.  Will review when/if I do.

  I really like the doorbell pro! I like that I have the ability to see who comes to my door when I am away. I also like that I have  the ability to have recording of every event that occurs. We have a lot of people walk by our home so I feel safe knowing that my doorbell is there for when I do not want to answer my door to a stranger.  The only issue I am having is with the audio. It is garbled most of the time and the person outside cannot hear what I am saying. I can hear them just fine but they cannot hear everything I am saying. I have looked up topics on this and cannot find anything. I would say the only thing I don't like is that there aren't many troubleshooting topics available.

  This thing is HORRIBLE! I thought that wiring it would make it more reliable but not a chance. This has literally worked 2 times (not days) and that was after resetting it and going through a bunch of steps. It is always offline and never warns you when it is not working.

I returned the original Ring after 2 months due to connectivity issues and the button sticking (thanks to Costco's awesome return policy). But so far this one is worth the extra money.<br><br>Initial pro setup was not too bad. The power box thing was the ""trickiest"" part ans wasn't that bad. The only setup issues I had were connectivity and getting my internal digital bell to ring. These sound serious, but were easy fixes.<br><br>Connectivity: I recommend a range extender for your Wi-Fi, even if your signal is decent. I placed it in the wall directly behind the Ring (interior)  best response time and functionality ever. The 5G is kind of a gimmicky feature, as the Ring really only needs the upload speed, and these are the same on both my 2 and 5 connection.<br><br>Getting Ring to ring my bell: Even though I selected digital bell in the setup, there is a ""backdoor"" setting in the app that controls the type of bell and chime play time. It defaulted to mechanical. Once I found this and switched it do digital, no issues. Again, this was my bell not a Ring chime.<br><br>Finally, compared to the older model... The 1080 is worth it. The sleek look with color choices is worth it. The ease of mounting with only 3 screws total, not 6, is worth it. Advanced motion is worth it. 5 Ghz is not really worth it, even though it was initially one of my big sells, download speed is irrelevant...get an extender.<br><br>More to follow. Hopefully all good.

  I recently bought a competing device with great reviews, totally disappointed. I normally don't write reviews but this item warranted it. The quality was obvious from the time you open the package, everything you need was there to install the device, even tools. The competitor required you to check voltages, purchase an adapter as needed separately. Ring had a regulator included. The competitor had a tiny set screw that was ridiculous to install. Ring image was drastically better. The motion sensor on the other device didn't work further than six inches away, (although this was probably malfunction). With ring you can adjust the sensitivity and the area of detection. make no mistake this is worth spending a little more!!!!!

  We have been using Ring for a few weeks now.  It installed very easily.  Our house was prewired for a doorbell.  I was able to put the doorbell into place with no issues and install the pack into the doorbell ringer.  It took me longer to figure out which fuse to turn off than it did to do the actual installation.  Setting up motion detection zones was easy.  We have had very few false alarms.  We also have appreciated it notifying us about motion when our children decide to go out the front door without our knowledge.  We get a phone alert and can stop them before they get very far.  It has been a nice accessory for our home.

The app on your phone walks you through the install and setup step by step.<br>I like that you can pick your alerts from someone ringing the doorbell or just plain motion. I also like how easy it is to set up the area that your motion covers . this  eliminates your phone being alerted every time a car drives by. The motion sensor is extremely helpful alerting me when a package arrives or just knowing that my son got home safe from school. Great for sitting outside by the pool anx not missing someone coming over. I also  the live monitor to check the weather outside when I'm on a trip. My neighbor loves mine because his kids constantly  leave the garage door open  he will  text me and asked me to check to see if his door is open. The quality is very good picture is very clear. The only issue I see is that when my Christmas lights outside go off at night it will set off the motion alert on my phone, not a big deal Christmas lights are only up for a short time.

  I installed the Ring Pro after trying a similar product which failed to reliably connect through my home wifi.  In contrast, the Ring maintains a solid connection and I see live views and recordings in a second or less from 5000 miles away.  The motion sensing is excellent and I have configured it so I get very few alarms due to activity away from my door.  Customer support was superb in helping work through my somewhat unique  setup.  For most non-technical people, installation should be easy and take only a few minutes.<br>I also have an elaborate  surveillance system, but the Ring is far more useful.

  Our HD RING has some really slow movies of the front door. ...  this is apparently due to our slow internet speed, so we're upgrading.  Be sure to set the motion detector to avoid the street or sidewalk in front of your house....or you'll be alarmed frequently.

The product itself is great, it was fairly easy to install (my husband did it), but from the chime to the actual viewing window is not timely.

  There is nothing more frustrating then getting notified there is someone at your door and Ring isn't able to produce a video. Ring has a massive need for perfect bandwidth (both phone and home internet) and if you have one or the other out of sync you won't be able to see what's happening at your front door. This is by far the biggest flaw of this device and with so many other options available on the market I would advise look elsewhere for something similar.

  The ring video doorbell pro is an easy doorbell to setup. The instructions give good instructions on how to connect the pro kit to your existing doorbell.

OR, app does not load live feed and get error message. Secondly, I have product for one week and 2 of the recordings were totally black. Customer service is very good, but if live feed takes a long time to open or not at all, then 90% of the the functionality is gone.<br><br>The video quality is also mediocre with motion displaying as grainy or just still shots.

  First thing you need to do if you are considering buying a Ring Video Doorbell Pro is to use a voltage tester on your existing doorbell wires to make sure that you have 16 - 24 volts to connect to.  If it's less than 16 volts you can upgrade your transformer (mine was in the basement) or the doorbell itself might need to be bypassed with an adapter available from Ring. The next thing you need to test is your wi-fi ""UPLOAD"" speed to make sure that it is 2 Mbps or more.  The best way to do this is to download an app on your phone like ""speedtest"" and find out. If you don't have at least 2 Mbps upload then you WILL be disappointed in the quality of the video you get. If your home meets these two requirements then you should be good to go. I actually received a defective ring from Amazon on the first shipment but after working with Ring support, I was sent a unit that has worked flawlessly since installation.<br>Bottom line is that it's a very cool product with a lot of potential but you must have the proper infrastructure in place or don't even bother.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Great doorbell camera,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2016","<span>
  Great product.  Would rate 5 stars but I had some issues with customer support (originally left 1 star review).  Turns out the issue I had was a defective item was shipped to me.  After hours spent on the phone with customer support, it turns out that the unit I received had a defect that Ring was aware of (they checked the MAC address of the doorbell).  Not sure how the unit made its way from customer 1 in North Carolina, packaged as new, and then sent to me in Texas.<br><br>Now that that mess is behind me, the doorbell itself is great.  Great at capturing motion.  The motion zones really help to prevent unwanted alerts.  Picture quality is great and the response time to your phone is quick when someone rings the doorbell.  I would recommend purchasing this product.

  My new Ring Doorbell-Pro works Great!  It was also very easy to install !  The directions for hardware instalation were simple, clear with big pictures, and the web video the same. This only took a few minutes, maybe 30 minutes max.  Then the APP to set-up the software was also easy &amp; simple!  It worked the first time I tried it!  When done with this, it was also easy to fine tune some of the settings, such as sensitivity, zones... "" All in All"" the installation was a good experience !

  I have already recommended this product to all my friends and family! The camera is SO clear and the night vision is great. I love the look of the ring doorbell itself - it is very sleek. Sometimes my ring detects snow when it is windy and flies in front of the camera which is annoying. Also sometimes when a delivery person steps onto our porch it only starts recording once they are leaving versus entering. But overall, I am very pleased with the product and am happy with my purchase.

  My wife and I now enjoy the security of knowing when anybody is now approaching our front door. Be aware though that using that option can become annoying if you have a lot of normal in and out traffic at your door.  The only complaint we have experienced is that occasionally we have experienced a lag before the video becomes available when the RING is triggered. We have yet to understand the reason for the lag as our wifi is quite robust. All in all we consider this to be a good investment and better than the other market options.

  The ring pro works great.  And it does exactly what they say.  But you know that.  Here is the kicker, you cannot appreciate the peace of mind until you have one.  I really like knowing exactly when a package is delivered.  And I really like knowing when people are on my porch, for whatever reason, when I am not at home.  This is not just ""nice to know"".  This is peace of mind.  Another thing, the Ring Customer Service is tops.  I had an unusual problem that was ultimately traced to my internet upload speed.  First, Ring CS is not a bot.  You get a real person.  Second, their emails are prompt, focused and helpful.  Even though my problem turned out not to be their fault, Ring CS ""owned"" it and ""solved"" it.  Who does that?  Ring!

  We tried to install this and got the correct indicator showing it should be able to see the wifi but it did not. Marina at Ring asked what the voltage was on the transformer, and when I said 10 v she said it needed to be at least 16 v. I replaced it with a 16 v transformer and still could not detect the wifi, (which I could on several other items at that location.) I called back and spoke to Jose, (I think) and he said 16v was a minimum, it should be 20v. So I then purchased the 20 v transformer and it still doesn't detect the wifi. I called back and spoke to Marina and she said it is probably the board and I need to return the item and have it replaced. I asked to have the board sent as a replacement but they did not respond to this request so I have requested a refund through Amazon and am shipping it back today. I would like this item but based on this experience of several hours fruitless work, new holes in the stucco, $25 in transformers purchase and reading other dissatisfied reviews, I am not certain I will purchase this again. Ring was pleasant but they did not seem to be as certain about the components of the item sufficient to know which board I had and whether there were verified issues with it.

  The Ring Video Pro solves many problems for our application - remote viewing and answering the front door of a home we occupy less than half the year, video alerts when packages are delivered (motion detector) and the ability to screen those who approach and ring the bell.  The installation was easy - both at the door and the inside power source.  Product is well-made and the design is efficient and aesthetically pleasing.  Slight gap on the video upload during some motion detection instances but overall the performance is excellent.  I suggested this product to many friends and will continue to do so.

  Overall very pleased. Works as expected. Install was very easy. Motion settings are accurate. As per the specs required I did need to replace my late 1990s transformer to a 16va- the original 10va powered it during day, but couldnt sustain at night.<br><br>My only complaint is that there is no lateral adjustment in the install holes. Drilling into stucco and my holes were slightly off, leading to a skewed install. With siding this likely is less of an issue as it is easier to drill accurately. Drilling into stucco is a bit of a tougher assignment and some wiggle room would have been really nice.

  I have had this for close to a year (early 2017). This worked OK for us for the first few months. After a couple of months, the physical doorbell in our house stopped ringing consistently (maybe 1 out of 10 times the button was pushed would our actual doorbell sound). Now it never rings. I cannot remember the last time it has. Beyond that, its my opinion that their cloud service is having major scalability issues. The service (that we are paying a monthly subscription to) is getting worse and worse. Following black friday of this year it basically has been worthless. I believe that they acquired a large number of new users due to good sales etc, that their cloud service cannot keep up with it. Now EVERY time someone rings the door and I get an alert on my phone, I click to pull up the app and it fails every single time. (from home on the same network as my ring). I have multiple enterprise wifi access points and networking throughout my house. The phone and doorbell have excellent signal strength, so it has nothing to do with that. The conditions in my house for this device to work, are far better than the avg. home, so if i'm having issues like this, then I would absolutely not recommend this product to anyone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Too Slow to be reliable.,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2017","<span>
  Too slow to be effective reliably. Great product idea, not worth the $250, by a long shot. Plus integrating with other devices requires much more independent research to get other branded devices to work rolled into a single app, if at all, I'm still unclear on that.<br>To ensure this device was adequately accommodated I bought a brand new wireless router, upgraded to internet speed 100+M and the device is within 20' of that router.<br>Sometimes the Ring Pro will catch most activity, other times it is too slow to load remotely. Block heads trails, black or grainy imagery happens. The slow loading is just simply painful, feels so rotary in a digital world. I paid the $30/year annual service after we saw random kids playing in the front yard. Of course the kids returned to take something off my porch today. The video didn't even start until the kids were within 6' of the Ring Pro on a reasonably clear day. 4+ WALKING SECONDS INTO THE ZONE. The zone feature IMO is a joke as it mostly works when my neighbor 30 yards away turns the car lights on/off at night, but wont pick up people letting their dogs do work on my lawn. Basically the zone system does not work.<br><br>Easy install. Had to return the first one through Amazon due to the image being black after set up. Walked through all set up steps again with their first line tech support (who just reads off a screen) 1.5 hours. Next level support takes about as long, but takes days to get an appointment so I had a useless device on my door. Did the slow customer service thing 2 times since I had to install twice and had the exact same problem twice.<br><br>Would not recommend Ring Pro at all. Too bad since it is such a great idea, but I'm already out the cost of the unit and the item stolen directly off my porch. Not asking the Ring People to stop crime, but I do expect their product to not only perform, but do so in a consistent and reliable manner. It's their premium product I expect it to perform based on the minimum standards they set out for their own products.<br><br>Now I have a less than useful device acting as a stand in for my doorbell until I can find a new solution.

We can talk to them and if we want to see them we ask them to go to the garage and we open the garage door.  It is very easy.  Also when we travel we can address visitors and they will not know if we are at home or not because we can talk to them thru the Ring.  We love it.  It was very easy to install.

With a weak wifi signal the doorbell won't give you live feedback, you get it a few seconds delayed. We picked up the Chime Pro, paired it with the doorbell in seconds and boom!

  I purchased this so that my wife use the Echo Show to see who is at the door before unlocking it.  The Ring doorbell does not automatically inspire the Echo Show to display the view to the door so you have to ask it and then it takes a while before it displays who is there.  It does work, but not as I had hoped.

  This doorbell works really well. I initially had a communication issue with my router. I have a parental control router (pcwrt) and my ""safe search"" settings were blocking the video feed to my phone. I assigned the doorbell to a separate ""unrestricted"" group in my router and the problem was solved. The video  (live or recorded) works great now whether I'm home or away.

  I bought the wired doorbell and Alarm System. Brilliant experience with both. Manual was clear, written in plain English and really easy to follow. All the bits you need are in the box (literally - it even included the drill bit). And the software made it really easy to set up. I think they'd pretty much thought of everything to make it a great experience.

Not sure what causes this. I would prefer wire nuts over the couplers. The couplers are bigger and took a little more effort to pack away. I helped my 3rd grader do the install. His first project.

1.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok when it works,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2017","<span>
  It's ok when it works. Setup took a few tries.  You practically have to have a WIFI repeater right on the other side of the wall to get it to connect.  Even when the WIFI connection quality says 'Okey' trying to connect for a live ring (or movement) and actually getting live video is very spotty. Trying to actually talk to someone live is even more challenging.  Seems like this thing needs a bit larger of a WIFI antenna.  So yes, the connection problems everyone talks about in the reviews are still there.<br>**Update**<br>After trying for a long time to solve ongoing issues with this product (bigger transformers, WiFi repeater, etc) it is now just locking up at random and requires a complete disconnect to be about to be reset to working again. DO NOT BUY THIS. Look elsewhere for your front door camera products.

  We like our Ring door bell, but had a couple of challenges. When some one rings the door bell, there is a slight delay for the cell phone to ring. This, of course is due to the WiFi delay. Also, the app only shows notification, but one still has to manually launch the Ring app to see who's at the door.  It would be great if the app automatically launches when the door button is pushed.

  Love the ring doorbell, however after 30 days you lose all your recording options. Is insane that after paying 250$ still you have to sign up for a monthly service to at least have the minimum recording capability. At a minimum Ring should offer a Basic plan that allows you save recordings for at least 7-days, like Arlo and some other similar devices. If I knew this before hand I would have bought something else. Thinking in returning it.

  I really like the ring doorbell and the security light/camera/siren.  I feel much more confident being able to see my door and driveway.  However, there is some delay in the video.  Also, I don't like that you need to also buy the cloud service to continue to record alerts.  I will be looking into the cloud service soon because this is an essential part of security.  There are other cameras where you can record the event directly from your phone or have it stored on your server or an NVR.<br>Lastly, you can't delete all the events at once.  If you've had a lot of events, cleaning that up may take awhile.

  This may be a good device, but I can't really tell because the wifi requirement is greater than the signal I have at my front door.  I have a great signal even 2 feet inside the front door, but outside, where the Ring needs a strong signal, it is poor.  Unfortunately, none of the marketing materials specify anything about exactly what kind of signal is required for this device to perform.  Signal extenders may be a help and I added one of those (factor that cost in when you are considering your purchase) and got performance up to ""mediocre"".<br><br>I filled out a survey they sent me and I gave an honest reply.  I immediately got a sweet reply telling me how they want me to be happy and how they would like an ""opportunity to turn your Ring experience around"".  I replied but got no further reply from them.  I inquired again, asking when I would hear from them. I got another prescription type letter telling me how much they want me to ""have a great Ring experience"".  We've had a few replies back and forth with no real helpful content.  I replied to the most recent message from them several days ago and have had no further response.  They have offered no solutions, and have not suggested any particular extender that might be helpful.  The only ""suggestions"" were a phone number to call and a website to visit.  I've seen the online information and spent hours trying to get this device to work well, I just don't have it in me to call CS and spend more hours having someone walk me through all the steps I have already taken.<br><br>BTW, my wifi signal is plenty strong in all the normal areas of the house, including the back deck, outside.  However, the signal just outside the front door is not strong enough to get a good result.  I realize this is not a problem caused by Ring, but it is a potential problem they do not address up front; and it is their problem (now mine) because their device relies on a good strong signal at a very specific location and they do not provide good information about this potential problem for one to consider prior to purchase.<br><br>I think this device may be very good, given a better signal, but I have no way of knowing.  I'm pretty much over messing with it, having already devoted many more hours to solving the problem than I prefer.  I will keep it because the mediocre result is better than nothing and I don't know of anything else this simple that provides any kind of security.<br><br>On the good side, installation was very easy, no glitches and it went just as pictured in the videos on you tube.  There are many features I really like about the product, or at least think I would like, if only the device worked as described.<br><br>I'm giving it 3 stars because I know the problems are wifi related and I think it would be a good unit with the proper signal.  Can't give it more than that because I've never seen it working well.

  Set-up was a nightmare, with a continual loop that said it was set-up, but then at the end, it would ask to log-in and start completely over again. A couple of times out of 30 or so tries, it did say it was set-up, only to have it lose the WiFi access and start the whole set-up process over again. After about 15 more times of doing this crazy loop, I gave up.  I initially rated it a 1 star because the phone app. software should never make you keep putting in the same basic information every time you do this loop. Why couldn't it remember something like my email address after the 30th time? I raised the review to a 3 star, since they were so good about reaching out to help me solve this issue.  I will see where it goes from here, but it may turn out that I don't have a fast enough wifi, so that may be something that needs to be disclosed on the listing if that is a problem they know about, but that might also mean that the product still works well for many customers.

Once you get the motion settings correct so every little motion doesn't set  it off, it's great!! But I love the chime sound.

The added security for seeing who is at the door alone is worth it, but the extras I didn't consider like knowing when packages are delivered when I'm not home or catching those pesky ding dong ditch brats. The night time video clarity is superb, and my favorite is the ability to identify the area to monitor for motion at such fine detail is outstanding. Just awesome!

  Love this product. Easy to install with the information provided and videos available on youtube. Handled it myself in less than an hour, including setting the motion zone.  The Ring.com door bell notifies you if the bell is rung or it detects motion within the range you set.  Simply click the notification to open the app to see your front door and who rang the bell or set off the motion alert.<br>Speak to them thru your app on your phone or Tablet.  I also installed a fe chime devices sold by Ring that you can put in rooms that may hear the door bell.  that way you hear the bell or motion alerts if you don't have your phone on you or have drained down the battery.  Picture is clear as can be.  Only issue is the motion sensor is so sensitive the flash of the lightening set it off at night, but I'm sure they will adjust their software to compensate for that in the future.

I tested the speed while standing next to the ring pro and further away outside of the house and my internet speed still reaches a consistant speed of 120-140 Mbps.

  OMG I don't know where to began. My husband bought this for me for Christmas and I could not wait to put it up so I asked him to go ahead and install it .. We must have tried everything known to man to get this doorbell to light up. We even upgraded the transformer to 24 v and we still got nothing. The bell will not light up or come on. It acts as if it can get power. So we call ed Ring twice and the guy walked us through the steps and still nothing so he asked us to send it back and they would send out a new one, so we did just that. When the new one arrived it was the same situation all over again, no light up, non working. We called Ring again after looking at tons of youtube videos and the guy from Ring asked up to return it and that he would send out a new 3rd device. All I can say is Ring has good customer service, but I dont want to keep wasting my time with this. The reps were extremely nice every time we called, but unfortunately that's all they got right....<br><br>In the beginning of 2018 Nest is coming out with the ""HELLO"" door bell and at this point I will just wait and give them a try.

  I'm a fan, love the ring pro I have. Installing was pretty straightforward, the video is decent. There is a pretty serious lag time to your doorbell operation though, so that's a thing...  I hope they come up with a way to actually manage the videos better, as it is, you have all the motion and doorbell videos listed sequentially, it would be nice to have a save file, or be able to make multiple files for different events, like the mailman, kids, dog walker, etc...

  So far this does what it says it will do.  Now that I have one that works.<br><br>I had several problems and had to have the device replaced.  When I hooked it up it would not generate the wifi connect network.  I installed and reinstalled according to directions, the light indicated it was in set up mode. I spent hours doing something that seemed very direct.  I called Ring and they guided me through the process several times.  They were very nice but no luck.  The technician finally mentioned that the unit requires 18V-24V AC.  Went a bought a circuit tester from Lowes.  Sure enough my transformer was generating 12V AC.  So the hunt for the transformer began.  After a long search and nice coating of cobwebs I found.  I ordered a 13.95 plug in transformer from Amazon then realized that solution would not work.  (I was going to return it, but shipping would have cost $7 to $13 to ship. Finally got a new 18V transformer from Home Depot. After more battle with fiberglass and spider webs.. it was set up.  Same results.  I called Ring.  The reviewed all I had done.  The sent me a new unit.<br><br>The new unit worked once installed!  I noticed that the Ring Pro Power Pack included was bigger than the original. There were other items packaged differently. So not only was the item defective it was apparently an earlier model.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Warning: Check transformer voltage before ordering!,15 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2016","<span>
  The Ring Video Doorbell Pro supposedly works with your existing doorbell wiring. This is NOT true if your existing doorbell voltage is less than 16 volts. I found this out only after ordering the unit, opening up the package, and coming upon a Warning sticker on the back of the Ring ""Only connect terminals to wiring from a doorbell with a voltage of 16 VAC to 24 VAC."" The transformer for my doorbell read 10 Volts. (Single doorbell, home built in 1996).<br><br>I contacted Ring tech support and they told me that it would not work. I asked if I could install a higher voltage transformer to use with my Nutone doorbell and they told me not to do that. So, I'm left with needing to return this and downgrading to the Ring Video Doorbell with a lower resolution camera and batteries. This will probably work out fine, but I feel mislead by Ring's claims. All they need to do is add an disclainer upfront about the voltage requirements!

  Compared to Zmoda I love this Ring Doorbell. Only had it for a day but I'm very impressed.  There are no shade issues under my porch like Zmoda. The Ring provides a wider and clearer view too. I didn't even have to rig the doorbell at an angle to see unlike the Zmoda. Motion setting on Ring is awesome! So far, no false trippings.<br>It's also nice you don't need to hold a button down to talk to someone at door. Only bad thing is the fee to save videos...but it's only 30 a year or  $3/mo. Zmoda is free but only 24 hour saves. I hope my Ring continues to wow me.  I'm glad I paid extra for a nice video doorbell.

  We love it so far. User friendly install and app setup. The ability to interact without opening the door is a desired home security feature for our family. There is a 7 second delay before the doorbell sounds, but the motion alert on your smart device responds instantly, so this isn't a big deal if you have your smart device nearby. If Ring would upgrade the sound delay this would be the perfect device.

  I purchased the Ring as a security feature hoping it would live up to my expectations.  It more than did that!<br>I paid for the Amazon installation and that too was a exceptional value.  The Ring works as advertised and the clarity of the video is wonderful even with night vision.  Just yesterday it was put to use as a neighbor backed into the side of my sons car but denied it.  I immediately checked my video from the Ring and sure enough there it showed the neighbor did back into it and proceeded to drive off.  We're a law enforcement family and feel that having the Ring is a truly great crime deterrent for neighborhoods, plus a great resource to see who is at your door before opening it.

  Great investment for the security of your home! I actually love it so much, I just purchased a Ring Stick Up cam, too! I purchased the Ring Pro about 6 weeks ago. I have not had one ounce of buyers remorse with this product. It has worked well everyday since we installed it. I originally purchased this to help me know when I needed to actually answer the door and when deliveries were being dropped off. I work from home and I am frequently on conference calls. I recently moved into a new neighborhood. My neighbors are super friendly and we're frequently dropping by in the middle of the day. Not that I don't appreciate their visits, but sometimes I was finding myself scrambling to end calls and answer the door, when it was a visit that could have waited. Same thing with delivery people - they usually rang the doorbell and walked away. I didn't need to rush to answer. We also purchased two somewhat pricey rocking chair for our front porch, and I was concerned about someone stealing them. The Ring Doorbell Pro seemed like the perfect solution for what I needed!<br><br>I chose the Pro over the regular Ring Doorbell for three main reasons. 1. I wanted the Doorbell to be hard wired into my existing doorbell. 2. The Ring Pro allows you to set custom zones for motion detection. 3. Video quality.<br><br>The way this Doorbell works for motion detection is like this:<br><br>1. When motion is detected in one of the configured zones, the Ring Doorbell Pro starts recording.<br>2. Ring Doorbell Pro sends an alert to your phone, via the app, telling you that motion has been detected.<br>3. The camera records the activity.<br>4. You can access the app and see the live view from the motion alert. You can also talk through the intercom.<br><br>The way the Ring Doorbell Pro works when the Doorbell is pushed:<br><br>1.

The doorbell continues to record.<br>6. You can access the app and see the live view from the doorbell alert. You can also talk through the intercom.<br><br>The installation was super easy, and any DIY'er that can read instructions can install the Ring Doorbell Pro without issue! The installations are easy to follow, well written and illustrated. It took my husband and I took less than an hour for the total installation. The product is well made. As I stated, I have had mine for 6 weeks and it is holding up nicely. The cover is subject to weather and sun. It hasn't had any issues with damage or discoloration. It still looks brand new, and the video quality is super clear.<br><br>The is a small delay between the time when the doorbell is pushed and when the alert is sent to my phone, I would estimate that the most time the delay ever takes is about a 1-2 second. I expected the delay, because that is just how wifi works.i see other people being critical in reviews about this, but I personally think this is normal and consistent with my expectations. I do sometimes occasionally get motion alerts on sun/shadows. Occasionally, headlights will pick up as motion at night. With the Pro, you can customize your zones, to make the alert system as efficient as possible.<br><br>A couple weeks ago, someone wrote vulgarities all over my son's car windows. The car was in the driveway and my Ring Doorbell Pro picked up the motion of the person who was tagging the car, We were able to indentify the person, based on the video that the Ring Pro took.<br><br>I have not installed my Ring Stick Up cam, but plan on installing this weekend!

  Works great until it doesn’t.  I am a professional in the Electronic Security industry, and I was excited to try this product for myself as Ring and other similar manufacturers are reshaping my industry.  I am now expecting my third (second replacement) Ring Video Door Bell Pro in the mail in just under one week.  First one, didn’t power up at all.  Returned for new one.  New one was awesome for 5 days.  It “overheated” according to Ring support.  I live in the Phoenix area so this is a huge concern of mine.  If it overheats in October what is the Summer going to do to it?<br><br>At first I was first upset but willing to accept the possibility that one bad unit slipped through to distribution. Then when the second one overheated and died on what I consider to be a comfortable autumn day I grew a bit frustrated.<br><br>• Pros:  When the second unit arrived it was a dream.  Good 1080p quality (daytime), ok night time quality.  It is what I expected it to be.  My favorite and unsuspected feature was being able to say good bye to my kids as they left for school and actually have a conversation with them through the two-way intercom from my office.  Their technical support didn’t argue with me or suggest that it was a problem with my wiring either time I called.  They were quick to help and they offered a replacement without fuss. They offered advanced replacement without a long RMA process or questionnaire.<br><br>•Cons: They seemed to focus more on the quality of the packaging than the quality of the product.  I hope my opinion changes next week when I install my third Ring Door bell.

  Worked great, until it stopped working. I installed the ring and it worked great for a little while - after getting a replacement on the first ring because it didn't want to work. Then it stopped working. They sent me a bypass cable. I installed it and it just wouldn't start again. I'd hit the reset button, and the light would only come on for a few seconds and then stop. I haven't been able to get it back online. And, now, I don't have a doorbell. I wasted the money on this product, the chime, and a year of subscription service - for a couple months of usage. Guhhhh. Wait until the next version gets this stuff fixed... or maybe just use a regular doorbell and forget monitoring for now. Frustrating.

  The motion detection on the Ring works well and the night vision is adequate, however, the follow through is lacking. I have a 400meg internet service, but when motion is detected at my door, it takes 5-10 minutes before I am able to see the video. If it is real time, it’s too late, the person has already been here and gone before I know it even happens.<br><br>Great concept, but needs a lot of work.

  Neat product, great video quality. Installation is straight forward, however, it took me two days of troubleshooting with the technical team.  After connecting the Ring Pro to the doorbell the unit didn't power up.  I checked the voltage delivery and it was OK.  I then try to measure the circuit resistance with the unit connected and the unit powered on, totally unexpected. This was me trying something else as a desperate measure, not really anything to do with troubleshooting.  I was about to return the item, hence 4 stars. After few days everything seems OK.

  After receiving the Ring Video Doorbell Pro ordered from Amazon, I was not able to have it immediately installed until I was able to get some electrical work done; needed a new transformer installed in order for the doorbell to work with my existing wired system.Once the transformer was installed the electrician still couldn’t get the doorbell to work. After the electrician spoke with the technical support team at RingPro, it was discovered that I received a defective unit. By this time I’d already missed the return window listed in Amazon and now have to wait another 10 days to have the unit replaced by the manufacturer. So disappointing.

After waiting a week with no contact, I called back many times, left message, left number but no one returned my call.  I have emailed, contacted them through the app, on their website, remained on hold for hours, but no one will respond.  I tried to fix this problem the correct way, but they just will not return calls (or answer them for that matter).  I have now taken it out of their hands and sent it back to Amazon, where they are gladly exchanging the item.  If the next one does not work correctly, I will be returning it as another failed electronic device from a small company. My advice would be wait for Nest to make one so it will function flawlessly and as advertised.<br><br>Update:  I received the new unit from Amazon and installed it today.  The live view functions as advertised on the new device.  After I posted the report, I received an email from Kandyce, the customer service manager.

   I have the costco cameras and frankly I was getting tired of them burning out, losing their night vision and having to run cable all over my house.  I got this door bell because my brother suggested it.  It is fantastic.  Very easy to install.  Now when I come in through my front door, my wife sees the notification on her cell phone, activates the mic and scares the holly crap out of me.  I love the fact that I can be 100 miles from my house and instantly see that an activation has occurred and actually talk to the people on the door step.  Most of the time they think I am inside with my sick kid and they go away.  The camera is really nice and does very well in the dark.  They even send you a drill bit in case you need to drill into stucco.  I am about to get another stand alone camera with a solar panel.  If you are thinking about switching or want a system that you can grow slowly, this is it.  OK however here is the negative (sorry everything isn't always a Polly Anna story).  I am having a problem deleting activations on my list.  Really not an issue because they are stored on the cloud and not on my phone.  But it is something Bryant at Ring has been working with me on.  They are very attentive and keep in touch by email.  Great tech support.  So don't let that be the only thing.  You will love this unit.

  Easy installation, however, if your existing doorbell’s transformer does not have an output of 20 volts with sufficient amperage, the unit may not hookup to your internet or function properly. I suggest checking your current transformer before installing the doorbell. If it is not adequate, change it out.

Also, the fact that visitors get recorded, and activities are saved online is great. Installing it was a breeze once *I changed the doorbell transformer* (went for the 16V 30VA option).

The customer services lady said it was an issues with the original firmware. She told me I would have to change the router password temporarily in my ASUS router to Alphanumeric in order to get the Ring doorbell to accept it. She said an updated firmware would automatically update it to firmware ver: 1.2.23. This firmware accepts special characters. I had to reset and the add the Ring Doorbell again as instructed to get it to accept the Alphanumeric password. Then I changed the router password back to the special characters.

  The Ring Doorbell Pro works perfectly as described, have being using the Ring Doorbell Pro for about a week now and I’m very satisfy with the doorbell.  Installation was very simple and fast, all necessary installation items was provided on the package.  The view quality is great during the day and night. Would consider installing other Ring products around my house for protection.  You get a 30 day trial to their protection plan after that you would need to pay the $30 dollars for a single unit protection plan, otherwise you won’t be able to see any of your unit recordings.<br><br>Would have giving 6 stars if Ring would have provided a non-costly way to view recordings.

  It does what it says it's supposed to do.  That's fairly rare these days, especially with this kind of tech which typically gets over ambitious on the features and then they don't work quite right.  My only minor gripe was that the physical doorbell stopped working after installation, making me think I screwed something up.  It worked a few hours later and is fine now.  I think the little white module you install in the doorbell box needs to charge up before it starts working right.  They should maybe tell folks about that?  I liked the instructions and the included tools was a nice touch.  Kudos, Ring people.

  It took several tries to make it work but now works well.

The second go was smooth. The doorbell installed without a hitch and is working well. I have a large house and bought 3 remote ringers. I'll soon be installing a spotlight cam as well.

  Package arrived- box damaged/ dinged; Ring box also torn on one corner (a gentle clue...).  Product did not come with any mounting plate and back of unit lacks proper design for attached wires and unit to lay flat against a wall absent a hole or depression behind the unit.  No additional mounting plates or gimbals provided.  Spent about 4-5 hours attempting to mount this unit and the accompanying pro-power module.  Two lengthy calls to Ring cust service (very nice people).  Unit deemed defective--would not turn on even when correct voltage confirmed at back of unit . Mailed back to seller.  Very disappointed and will not buy another.  A big headache.

  Previously I had a Foscam 8910 IP Camera setup at my front door with motion detection.  It had 2 way communication but the quality was so bad that it was useless for sound.  Decided to purchase this because it was a.  aesthetically pleasing and b. easy to setup and use.  The problem with my previous setup was that the alerts were delayed so much that I couldn't ""answer"" the door when someone triggered the camera.  Plus it took a few seconds to access the app on my phone to view the camera.<br><br>Now I have clear communication with anyone that comes to my front door whether I'm at home or not.  Alerts work great.  I'm able to answer the door whenever someone rings the doorbell or when motion is detected. This is a great security feature as most burglars will ring the doorbell before breaking into your home.  If they know you are aware of their presence, you are almost guaranteed that they will not break in.<br><br>The camera has a fish eye lens so even though it is mounted at normal doorbell height (about 36 inches from the ground), you can still view full bodies and a pretty wide areas.  Video quality is excellent.  I hear its not true HD (1080p) but its definitely clear enough to identify people.<br><br>If I were to nitpick, it would be nice if the sensor for motion detection was customizable.  For some reason the camera is triggered everytime I turn off the light in my foyer.  Also, when my existing camera's night vision light turns on, it triggers the ring camera.  I can live with this as long as I know that 90% of the time the alerts are valid.<br><br>I also opted for to pay $30/yr for the cloud service.

  This product is a great concept, but it has way too many problems. First, the app is made for the regular Ring and includes instructions that can't be followed for the Ring Pro. In addition, it was necessary to ""set motion area"" even though I had to dig to find it. Then, when I tried to use Live View, there was about 1 minute delay for the video to start, which is unacceptably long. But shortly after setup, the product stopped working without any warning and had to have the faceplate removed in order to put it back into setup mode and reconnect to wifi, because it needed to update software. It went through about 3 software update cycles over the next few hours, each time without warning that it had gone off-line. Then, the next day I noticed it wasn't working again (again, the app didn't tell me it had lost connection to the doorbell) and needed to be reconnected to wifi. The following day, same thing, only that time it was completely unresponsive and couldn't be put into setup mode at all. We reconnected all the wiring, which all appeared to be well connected to start with.  Then, a few hours later, it needed to be reconnected to wifi again (after I checked the app). My router has good signal and is about 10 ft from the indoor doorbell and about 20 ft from the Ring doorbell at the front door. There isn't anyplace closer that would be convenient to put my router, and it would be ridiculous if the Ring and router have to be closer than that in order to work. In addition, it's ridiculous that the app doesn't notify the user when the connection to the Ring is lost, and that it doesn't have instructions for setting up Ring Pro. I love this idea, but the implementation is terrible. Wait until the technology matures enough to actually be useful, and then consider getting another brand from a company that wouldn't rush to market before these types of issues were worked out.

  I have been using the doorbell camera for a week now. During the day it works almost perfectly. There is a slight delay between the time the doorbell is pressed and the time the chime sounds but it’s only about one second and it’s not a problem for me. Occasionally someone will walk all the way up to the door without triggering an alert but that rarely happens.<br><br>At night it’s a whole different ball game. There are no recordings and no notifications at all. The list of events in the app shows nothing between the hours of 11 pm and 6:30 am. I have a 19 year old who needless to say often comes in during those hours and in 7 days it hasn’t picked him up once.  I have a reolink camera mounted above the ring pro and it picks up all of the after dark motion. The reolink eats batteries so I was hoping the more expensive ring pro would be a better solution. I have checked the motion settings to make sure I hadn’t accidentally set the camera to ignore motion during those hours but the settings are correct. A security camera that only works during the day is certainly not what I was hoping for.<br><br>I have read posts online about this same issue. They indicated that Ring was aware of this issue and that it would be addressed in a firmware update. However those posts were over 90 days old so I’m not holding my breath. Very disappointing because if it was as good at night as it is during the day I would be very happy with it. Please Ring, fix this issue!

  With a few days of operation under our belt, the Ring Pro has worked as advertised.  But the really remarkable aspect from my perspective was the lucid, thoughtful, and complete installation package and instructions.  Every step was laid out in a clear, logical format.  All of my questions were anticipated in the materials.  We have a fairly modern (~20 year old) doorbell with a modern power supply and a wood frame, so the installation skipped some of the more cumbersome steps.  But all in all, the Ring Pro went from the box to installed and operational in less than one hour.

  I love everything about this, but there are some quality issues.<br>1) The 1080p video compression looks pretty crappy. While streaming I understand why, but I wish afterwards I could access a higher bitrate stream.<br>2) The motion sensor often gets tripped by the sun (working on modifying monitored regions).<br>3) When the motion sensor is going off, you cant get to it in the mobile app to stop it from ringing until the motion completely stops. So if someone is working on your front porch, you're kind of screwed (I reported this bug).<br>4) Also, it only supports Windows 10 for its mobile app &gt;:- ( . This one made me very unhappy.<br><br>Also when installing it, it wasn't working, so I worked with the customer service. The first technician told me it was a problem with my transformer (we tested with a multimeter). So I spent 20 minutes searching for it in my attic and confirming that what I found was in fact the doorbell transformer, and it was fine. After calling back to talk to a second customer rep, he told me that the blink code meant it needed a firmware update. Very thankful the second rep was competent, as replacing the transformer would have been a major PITA.

  We bought a Ring Doorbell, thinking this would solve the issue of dogs barking every time a solicitor or a mailman rang the bell, as well any issues with stolen packages. My husband installed the doorbell per the instructions and it was working... but then every day or two, the doorbell would stop working. He did a lot of research to try to fix it, ran diagnostics, etc The ONLY way to get the doorbell back online was to flip the breaker- even though the doorbell was *not* tripping the breaker. Nothing worked to permanently solve the problem so he called tech support. They weren't really helpful, said something about how maybe the next software updates would fix the issue.<br><br>We requested a replacement product through Amazon, seeing it could very well be a bum product. Not a big deal and we didn't want to be outside any return policy if the issue wasn't resolved via an update.<br><br>Ring Pro the Second comes in the mail.<br><br>My husband installed it yesterday and got it working. This morning, it's offline. So when he got home, he was checking to see if he can get it back online. Unfortunately, it appears to have blown our transformer. My husband used multimeter to measure the voltage when he was troubleshooting the original Ring Pro that we received and there was voltage to the wiring. After the issues with the second Ring Pro, he used the multimeter again to measure voltage to the wiring and we now have zero voltage. We're unable to install the old doorbell so we are without a doorbell at this point.<br><br>We called Ring back. They won't do anything for us except offer us an exchange (for doorbell #3). But now we have to hire an electrician to come out and fix this transformer.<br><br>It's entirely possible that our transformer was an issue and on its way out... but our house was built in 2012 and we weren't having issues with our normal doorbell (that we know of) prior to installing the Ring. Hopefully the electrician will be able to give us a better idea what caused the problem. Our concern is that IF the Ring is the problem, we don't want to install a new one after getting the transformer fixed- in case it does the SAME thing and we have to hire an electrician to come out again.<br><br>And we wasted hours of time trying to fix and troubleshoot a doorbell.  Argh. So that's our feedback.<br><br>For the few times it worked, it was neat. Video quality was great. There are options to adjust the sensitivity of the Ring so you won't get notifications for every car that drives by. I am enamored with the IDEA because a smart home, but when something doesn't work right then it gets to be a huge hassle compared to just using a regular doorbell.

I also see that others have experienced the same issue and Ring apparently does not care.  After reading the reviews of Ring's customer service, I did not bother to call them.  Contacting them would not solve anything and just add to my frustration.  Will not be purchasing any Ring products in the future.

  I was skeptical about buying a video doorbell.  After reading several reviews on this and other video doorbells I decided to take a chance on this one.  It's pricier than what others are offering.  The biggest concern for me is reliability.  This is where Ring seemed to review better than it's competitors.  I had to improve my WiFi connection in the area near the doorbell.  The investment was worth it.  The video is clear, the motion sensor is sensitive.  The audio quality is great.  There is a slight delay from the time someone presses the Ring until the doorbell in the house chimes.  The does not seem instantaneous either, but this is expected.<br><br>Install:<br>I had a some trouble installing the remote on my actual doorbell chime inside the house; it's a bulky unit with short wires.  I should have researched more to understand that you need to install something inside the house also. The main unit outside my house was easy to install.  Unfortunately, my doorbell is on the side of the entry, so the way I install it gives me a limited viewing angle.  A plus for the ring is that it has a large viewing angle.  It's definitely not 180 degrees.  It would be nice if there was an install kit that allowed me to angle the doorbell how I wanted it.  Once installed it is secure.<br><br>I do not like that I have to pay a yearly fee to get the cloud service.  This seems to be the only way to view anything that's not live.  This only increases the overall cost of the product.  The tech in this space is only a few years old. I am hoping the tech will improve, and competitors drive prices down so I can get built in cloud service, or the ability to store on to my device.

  I had high hopes for this camera, but it is extremely slow. The only good thing about the unit thus far, was the installation. Ring did a great job at writing instructions that were really easy to follow. The process of installing a new doorbell is straightforward, but it was well written. That is where the good ends. Here is a list of the issues I have been having after three days of use.<br><br>-The Ring App: It is terrible. When you get the alert that there is motion at your door, and you click on the alert, 9/10 times for me, the live view just spins. I rarely get to actually see what this motion is. There is also a log history of all the motion detections, and rings. Almost all of my videos are choppy. It almost looks like I am watching a video on the original Nintendo Gameboy. I have enough bandwidth to support a much higher resolution, but it is choppy.<br><br>-The motion detection: This thing will pick up a school bus on the road that is over 20 feet away from the front door, but it will start recording motion when someone is actually at the front door well after they have begun knocking. For deliveries, by the time the camera starts recording, the driver is already walking away, or in the vehicle.<br><br>-The Ring website: This is another failure. The logs of all of the events are here online, for you to download. Over the past 24-hours, all of the videos that the camera picked up have been nothing but white screens, and choppy audio.<br><br>-Delay on doorbell: For some reason, when you press the Ring button outside, it takes a couple of seconds for the Ring device outside to activate, then ring your bell inside. It is a hard wired, physical connection. The doorbell inside should ring immediately upon pressing the button outside. It takes another several seconds to actually get the alert that someone rang your bell on your device.<br><br>-Audio: I ran some tests to see how the clarity of the audo is on the bell unit. Well, it isn't very good. It sounds as if you're talking to someone with a snorkel in their mouth. My voice was equally as muffled coming out of the doorbell speaker.<br><br>The device seems nifty, but it isn't very practical. I will go ahead and assume that most of the other WiFi doorbell units are about the same. I am going to be returning our unit.

  Unfortunately, the chime doesn't work with my existing doorbell as the Ring Pro says it will. When it was first installed, it worked a time or two, but stopped. My installation guy (not from Amazon) can not figure it out. Since there is a delay between the time the camera detects motion and the time I get the phone alert, this is not ideal.

  This doorbell is awesome! For those of you like me who like to have a connected home and a smart device, this is REALLY cool! I had it installed by HelloTech, which through a promotion through RIng's website will install at a flat rate of $50 regardless of how many devices (doorbells, cameras, etc) you have to install. I just didn't want to deal with it so I paid the cost for the install and I have no regrets. The app is really cool in how you can set motion zones and the sensitivity, although I see it'll take a bit to reduce the amount of false positive alerts. You're given a 30 day cloud recording trial in which all your events (every time you tune in live, recorded motion, answered rings, etc) are stored in the cloud and can be downloaded to provide the police should anything criminal occur. I also love the ability to talk through my phone to whoever is out on my front porch. That should come in handy sometime in the future, I'm sure. Overall, this is a really cool doorbell. Is it totally unnecessary? Yes. Who cares though? Not me. I'd recommend checking out their Facebook page and seeing all the videos they post of people stealing packages or trying to break into the gate to the house. That alone makes the price tag worth it along with the guarantee that if it gets stolen they'll replace it for free. Can't recommend this enough!

  I'd love to rate this higher, because when it works, it works great, but it's taken a bit of experimenting to get it to work most of the time. I have 1000mbps fios internet service which is seriously fast, both hard wired and wireless. The doorbell would work sometimes but not at others when I first received it so I had a replacement sent (Ring customer service was great to work with, although they didn't completely solve the issue - more on that to come.) The replacement had the same blackout and non-response livewiew issues as the first one. So the first thing the Ring folks said was that the RSSI should be less than -50. I moved my router closer to the front door and still only got the RSSI to -54. I have a hard time believing I need to move it even closer since my wireless router is now within 15 feet of the front door yet my download and upload speeds are in excess of 100mbps using 2g measured at the doorbell! Pretty fast if you ask me! Their solution of moving the router even closer just wasn't possible in my home. Funny thing was when I switched to my wifi range extender which is located 40 feet from the front door it worked better despite showing about the same RSSI yet only 25mbps up/download speeds. So I finally got the idea to switch to the 5g settings on the main wifi router and connected with RSSI at only -72!! with download and upload speeds of 400+mbps, yet now it works 95% of the time. I wish it was 100% and think I should expect no less than that so long as my wifi is working well, which it is. I believe Ring needs to upgrade the antenna in the Ring Pro unit and bet they would solve most of the many issues I have read about similar to mine (the doorbell not working, blank recordings and live view that doesn't work at times.) Try the 5g band if your wifi router supports it. Now wondering if I should buy a couple of Ring stickup cameras which will be farther away...

  Things that can effect this:  location of doorbell, light if you have a covered porch, and internet connection.  Sometimes during the day on our covered porch you can't see the image well.  Also, sometimes there is no image even though the device was triggered with movement (after waiting for it to be uploaded).  Also, defining the motion area is easy but tricky.

  There is a lot to like about the Ring Pro.  Be advised, though.  If you have two doorbells, both can't be a Ring Pro on the same door bell transformer circuit.  Plus, you have to add a booster to your doorbell circuit.  And you need probably cable quality internet - probably more than phone line internet - to capture the video form your doorbell.  The smaller design is defiintely nice.  Hopefullly the next version will take the benefits of Ring and Ring Pro. I""d buy the Ring, but only the Pro if you have one door and fast internet.

  Ring Pro is an excellent product with tremendous potential.  I have been a ring pro customer for over 3 months, and I am pretty impressed with the product.  It outperforms it's competition by miles.  Mileage my vary with the product depending on how far your ring device is from your router.  My best recommendation for flawless service would be to invest in a $40 range extender and just install it close to the ring device. The Ring Pro still has a lot of work to do, however it's still the best option in the market.  Below is a list of Pro's and Con's<br><br>Pros:<br>~ Easy Installation<br>~ Slim Design<br>~ Good Video Recording Quality<br>~ Excellent motion sensing capability (With the latest update, you can now control motion sensitivity)<br>~ With the recent app update, you can now view ""Health Status"" of the ring including wifi signal<br><br>Cons: (This is where I believe the product has room for improvement)<br><br>~ Video in ""Live View"" is choppy at times.<br>~ Missing one of the most important piece...A backup battery (Gen 1 has a battery, but not Gen 2)<br>~ Wish you could rename Alerts or move them to a Separate Folder within the app, so you can find them easily<br>~ Wish there was a way to reboot the ring from the app<br><br>Although it has room for growth, overall the Ring Pro is a great product compared to its competition.

  As many other said: this is clearly a ""beta"" product rushed to the market. Great idea, but implementation quality is on a prototype level.<br>Pros: it connected to my WiFi easy enough and video quality was adequate. Unit looks nice too. But that is where good stuff ended<br>Cons: My doorbell would not ring (and yes, I installed on my doorbell that afterthought contraption provided with the unit)<br>Doorbell just makes a sad little sound which is barely enough to get my dogs worked up. Yes, it is an analog doorbell, yes, that's the setting I picked (tried the other one just in case). Second and more important issue: the level and quality of the audio (as played back by the Ring) is exceptionally low. You almost have to lean to the unit to hear anything. And is this not teh strongest selling point: to maintain a 2-way conversation with whomever is at your door? Otherwise just get a dropcam with motion detection for 100 bucks and be done. It is quite possible that I have got a defective unit or a firmware update would have fixed it, but at this price point I do not expect a product that requires tinkering. I feel that I'm being reasonable in my expectations: I'm fine with screwing around with wires on my doorbell if that's what it takes. Clearly you have to expect to spend a bit of time connecting it to your wireless network, but after that should it not just work?.. On its way back

5.0 out of 5 stars,The Ring Video doorbell is a must for home security,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2017","<span>
  I love my ring doorbell.  It is very simple to install and setup.  It took me no time at all to install it.  My husband was at work, so I did it by myself.  The only issue we had was the motion sensor going off when our neighbor goes to work at 3:00 in the morning and every time there was lightening outside.  All we had to do was adjust the settings.  It makes me feel a lot safer when I'm at home alone.  It also gives my husband peace of mind when he is away for work.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Product, Some Issues",2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2017","<span>
  Overall, I think the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is a good product. The picture is very good, and it was easy to install. However, the device I originally received kept switching to infrared/night vision and getting stuck there, even on bright days. The only way to get it back to normal was to switch the power off at the breaker, wait about 30 seconds after the doorbell powered down, and flip the breaker back on, or to set up the doorbell again. I called Ring's support, and after having me try several things (changing motion zones, setting up the device again), they sent me a replacement device when the problem occurred again. I have been very impressed with Ring's support so far. Based on the initial call, I was handed to one support person, and I have dealt with her on everything through calls and emails. It's nice to not have to re-explain the issue for each contact.<br><br>Once the replacement doorbell arrived, I discovered a new problem. The security screw that holds the face plate onto the doorbell and requires the special, included screwdriver, is made of very soft metal, and it couldn't handle all of the removing of the face plate to access the setup button. It was stripped, but we were finally able to remove it with needle nose pliers. This seems to be a common problem.<br><br>I have had the replacement doorbell installed for about 2 weeks. It also occasionally gets stuck in infrared/night vision, but not nearly as often as the original device. I have also discovered that entering setup mode and immediately cancelling setup switches it back to normal/day vision, which makes me hope it is a firmware issue that will eventually be fixed. Because of the need to access the setup button to reset the doorbell and the soft screw that strips easily to attach the face plate, I have not yet attached the face plate to the new doorbell.<br><br>One other odd thing - my 30-day free trial of cloud recording only lasted 26 days.

3.0 out of 5 stars,The PRO unit is much slimmer and mounted nicely to the wood door brick molding,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2016","<span>
  UPDATE: 9/1/17:  Around August 10, the quality of the nighttime/night vision video degraded tremendously.  After chatting with Ring Support, I learned Ring pushed out a firmware upgrade that lowered the video threshold and as I said, my quality greatly diminished.  There is no way to go back to the previous firmware version and no way to keep them from pushing an upgrade without your knowledge.  I had a working system that I was happy with for nearly a year and they totally screwed it up.  Night videos now break up and and are just horrible. I had a 100 watt daylight LED porch light that provided night video in color and now the system no longer recognizes my lighting and changes to its built in black and white night vision. I am so disappointed with Ring that I am looking to dump this and go to something else.  No way I would consider other Ring products for additional outdoor security.  I will look to other systems and options.<br><br>I had to select the PRO unit over the standard because of mounting width.  The PRO unit is much slimmer and mounted nicely to the wood door brick molding.  Installation was very simple and the included instructions were more than adequate.  What I did not understand before purchase was my existing doorbell inside the house will still continue to ring. I mistakenly thought this totally disconnected it and only used the wiring for power.  (The PRO requires a hardwired standard doorbell as it contains no rechargeable battery -  whereas the standard wider unit can be wireless or wired).  I also purchased two of the add on chime units.  They say you can add as many as you want.  Since my doorbell continues to ring normally,  I'll place these in a downstairs location.  So it took me about an hour top to bottom to complete the install and app setup.  Initially I did not see any video from live view or upon doorbell ring so I instinctively restarted my phone and everything works as advertised.  A few hours does not make a trend but so far it seems to be a total winner and I am very pleased.

  I was debating between the Ring Doorbell Pro and Skybell HD. The deal breaker was Ring’s interaction with my Echo Show. Now, you can lock and view the door, but currently CANNOT unlock. I hope an update one day will resolve that. However, I use my Schlage app to lock the door. I actually had an issue installing my Ring but after contacting customer service, who was very helpful, they sent me a replacement doorbell and I had no issues getting it up and running. Yes, you pay $3 a month for cloud service, but my family’s safety really has no price tag. The 1080P video feed to the Show is very nice, although I cannot speak to whoever is at the door through the Show yet. Install is a breeze and includes a power cable kit that is even easier to install to your existing mechanical chime. The Pro is sleek and slim and comes with FOUR different color faceplates. The customer support Is amazing. App interface is great and easy to set up. Setting up with Alexa was a breeze. I’m glad I made this choice over the Skybell.

  I would have rated it a ""0"" but that was not an option.  It worked good for 30 days then you are reduced to nothing more than an ordinary doorbell unless you purchase their cloud service which is free for 30 days.  They do not tell you that the only thing that you get without the cloud service purchase is nothing more than live view, which can be accomplished much more cheaply and reliably with a security camera.  Not worth the money and as far as I am concerned no better than an ordinary door bell not to mention, I feel, false advertising.

  It's a great product! I had to install it with a direct 24 volt transformer due to no existing chime transformer that would meed the specs, but it didn't complicate the process much at all. I do think that since a fused cable has to run between one connector and the transformer, it would be good to either include it in the kit or allow the customer to purchase it as an accessory at the time of purchase for the doorbell. That way there would be no delay waiting for a fused connector while the doorbell sits idle in the box.

  The Ring Pro is my first exterior smart device, and its a simple and to the point solution. It provides an enhanced doorbell with the added benefit of home security. I had this particular device for two reasons, direct recommendation from my friend and there has been recent reports of suspicion behavior in my neighborhood. Below details are more specific:<br><br>Installation: The installation is very easy which only require two modifications. One to the existing doorbell, its a simple swap out using the same wiring. The other is an installation of a Ring provided transformer in your chime box. Both are very simple and ANYONE can do it themselves. No special tools are required other than your normal screw drivers. Just follow the provided directions and watch the 5 minute video to get a quick overview.<br><br>Ring Pro hardware: The Ring pro itself is actually quite compact; I was actually surprised since the product picture (without context) make it appear to be larger than it really is. I'd say its about 2.5 times larger than a traditional doorbell. The device appears to be solid construction based on plastic housing. Its installation design has anti-theft in mind making stealing of the device a bit more difficult and/or inefficient. It has a sleek design and without getting up close and personal you couldn't tell that its a smart device.<br><br>Software: I use the App on an Android device, and its pretty straight forward and initiative. They include a 30 day trial for cloud storage; without it you still get notifications and LIVE view only; no recordings.<br><br>Firewall NOTES: My companies firewall blocks from being able to access the live view so I have to turn off WiFi if I want to connect.

   My overall impressions after using it for several weeks. Bear in mind I have never used a Ring type device, or any other similar doorbell camera....<br><br>Audio quality:<br>Audio quality is fair, it sounds good on my end, but on the Ring end the volume is very low and hard to hear. Volume cannot be adjusted on the Ring device.<br><br>Video Quality:<br>Video quality is pretty good. I was hoping it was a little sharper but for a wifi camera it’s pretty good. 1080P sounds great, but if the camera is low in megapixel’s its not going to be that sharp. I could not find mega pixel specs anywhere on Ring’s website. For example a 4mp camera will let you see license plates. I’m guessing this camera is in the 1mp range.<br><br>Alert Quality:<br>Ring alerts are pretty quick with exceptions. If the doorbell is rung, the alert is very quick. if the doorbell is not rung, not so quick. I have gotten several motion alerts after the driver is on his/her way back to the truck because Ring did not catch them on their way up my walkway and they did not ring the doorbell.<br><br>Other:<br>I use the Ring app on iOS devices. The Ring alert sound is nice, wind chimes, but would like the ability to change the alert tone. For some reason on my Wife's phone, the default Ring alert tone changed on its own to the default iOS notification sound…..which suck, and as far as I can tell there is no way to change it back. I have emailed tech support at Ring but have not gotten a response as of this review. I did just send it though…<br><br>Install:<br>The Ring Pro is more narrow then the original Ring. For folks that have a round doorbell, this may not cover the entire width of the hole. It did not in my case so I filled the gaps with paintable silicone which worked out fine. Other then that the install was very easy and was up and running in about 30 minutes.<br><br>I would probably buy the Ring Pro again. Overall it does what it is designed to do……Alert me if someone is walking up our walkway, and alert me if someone rings the bell. Does it need some improvements? Yes…..<br><br>I would like to see more options in the app, for example to restart the device, or turn the Ring speaker volume up or down.

  I had the original Ring and returned it because of the really bad lag and the numerous false alarms.  I thought the Ring Pro would be an improved version.  It looks better and there's an included plastic back plate that fits over the previous holes left by the old Ring.  Followed the instructions in detail and it gets hung up on trying to connect to the wifi.  I have tried numerous times and even reset the router.  Even unhooked the power to the doorbell and reinstalled it.  All my other IOT devices connect easily.  It should not have to be this difficult.  If the previous version could connect easily, no reason this ""improved"" version should not. I even bought two of these, installed them and tested them.  Like several other reviewers, all I managed to get after multiple attempts was the flashing white ring.  Waste of time and money.

  First and foremost the unit itself is very good. However it requires a 16 volts to 24 volts alternating current (A.C.) supply. It relies on a transformer to gives this voltage or you can connect it to your door bell chime. As my chime uses 8 volts I had to purchase a 24V transformer. I use an Asus router and try as I could, I couldn't get the Doorbell Pro to connect to it. Other routers, according to forums on the subject, appear to work. Distance from the Doorbell Pro to the router was well within the limits. I purchased a repeater for the Asus router and yes the Ring Pro did connect to that. However I still have the problem that when I press the Ring Pro I get no notification on my cellular phone. I can go into the Ring App on my phone and I can see that I have someone at the door. I can see them* and talk to them. However I am still working with the Ring Pro team in resolving my issue.<br>* Although the video is good at night time using the built-in infra red emitters, daylight mode for facial features can be bad if the background is very bright as the person appears dark.

  I'll preface this review with the comment that I've purchased over 1,000 items on Amazon and this is my first review to warn others before they drop a lot of money on this system. The Ring Doorbell Pro is a very cool idea and when it works properly it is great. I was so excited after installing my Ring Pro that I requested another for Christmas and the Ring Stick-Up cam to have cameras on every door to my house. After receiving my second Doorbell and the Stick-up cam is when issues arose. If you have two existing doorbells hooked up to the same transformer you can not operate 2 hard wired Ring Doorbells. This is not disclosed on the packaging or in any of the instructions provided. It is only disclosed on a hard to find FAQ page on the website which I only discovered after spending hours trying to set up the second Doorbell. However, I now have an opened non returnable $250 Doorbell and the only way to make it work is to hire an electrician to establish a second transformer for the doorbell. With transparent disclosures this would not have happened so be warned in advance. Second warning is that if you have an old mechanical doorbell chime in your house, the Ring Doorbell may take up too much juice to get the mechanical chime to sound loud enough to hear. I had to buy the optional Ring Chime to be able to hear the doorbell throughout my house for another $50. With those warnings out of the way here are the pros and cons:<br><br>Pros:<br>1) it is very easy to install your first doorbell. Instructions are straight forward so even someone with no electrical wiring experience can figure it out<br>2) the alerts and notifications are very cool. You can set up motion alerts so you know when the mailman is at your door and it will even pick up whether a bird has landed on your stoop or a butterfly is fluttering in front of the camera<br>3) night vision is good enough, day time is great although video can be chopppy (e.g., cars driving by may look like a blur) but adequate<br>4) IF you sign up for the $3 a month cloud storage you can view playback of any motion or Doorbell Ring events<br><br>Cons:<br>1) Customer service is inadequate. You get a notification that you will hear a response within 24 hours. The only time I used it I was having issues where half the video playback was a green screen and it took 3 days for a response. The response did not provide a solution, just an offer for a free Ring Chime for not responding in a timely manner. Given I had already purchased a Ring Chime this was a worthless offer to me and my problem was not resolved.<br>2) you can't have multiple hard wired doorbells with the most common form of wiring for existing homes with 2 doorbells, so multiple hard wired doorbells will require the average person to contract an electrician and potentially having to run new wiring.<br>3) After your 30 day free trial for cloud storage expires you can no longer view any video playback. Not even the most recent event, so the doorbell becomes only a real time live viewing device<br>4) the Ring Chime works fine to alert you, but it offers multiple Chime tones and I have yet been able to make any of them work but the standard preset tone. Maybe just a defective device, but I'm done using any additional Ring devices and have not found customer service to be helpful so I'm content using the standard tone.<br>5) Video playback worked 75-80% of the time to date, but the rest of the time I've had a black screen or a green blurred screen.<br><br>In summary it's a cool device when it works, but customer service is not what it claims to be and there are still some kinks. I wouldn't buy again, but I've got $550 worth of their product that I can't return so I'll supplement it with products from Nest or others to fill out my security system.

  What a joke! $250 for a doorbell that shows pics of who's ringing. There is one choice of ring on this ripoff doorbell. Even free cellphones have over 50 ring choices, yet this $250 doorbell has as many rings as a $5 one. And when you connect the app, if you want to be notified about someone ringing the bell or movement by the doorway, the app rings your phone and there is no way to turn it off.<br><br>Not sure what kind of cheap programmer they got to design this awful app but anyone worth their salt would be able to have a simple notification on your phone without forcing it to ring and disturbing you and your company. The CEO Jamie Siminoff is a human-hype machine always over-promising yet under-delivering. A whole lot of hype here but it really strikes out. Not to mention after whacking you for $250 for the doorbell, the company tries to suck more money out of you for bogus extras!

  This is a good product with nice features (better than the original Ring doorbell), however it's not for everyone! In a discussion with the Ring support staff (who are the absolute BEST support staff I have ever dealt with), the Ring Video Doorbell Pro needs a MINIMUM of 2 MBPS UPLOAD speed to work properly (i.e. how fast your computer/wifi can push data UP to the internet - NOT how fast you can download data). I can verify this as true as I measured 1.95 MBPS upload speed and the video was very low quality, pixelated and jerky (and I had to return the unit). Do yourself a favor and verify your upload speed BEFORE you buy this or you will not be happy if you don't have the bandwidth. If you do have a good upload speed then enjoy this great product!

After 48 hours I emailed them again and got a response asking for more information, I responded in 10 minutes with all of the requested information, I got no response in a week and returned it to Amazon.<br><br>Like an idiot, I figured the Pro version must be much better and ordered it.  I hooked it up per the instructions and it worked but would NOT ring my doorbell that IS on the compatible list.  I contacted tech support via chat this time and explained that there was 0VAC being provided to my digital doorbell (to me I would guess a bad power module) there solution was to send me a power bi-pass and a digital ringer.

I am not a handy person, but the instructions were very simple and I was able to remove my doorbell, wire the device, secure it to the house, and connect it to the wi-fi.  I did have difficulties connecting to wi-fi, but I called the support line and they were very helpful (I needed to do a hard reset on the device for it to recognize my wi-fi router).<br><br>We spent 15 days on the other side of the country, and I was able to respond to activity (I got a text message indicating sensor activity at the door, and it also notifies you if someone rings your doorbell) and peer through the camera at all hours of the day.  The resolution on my phone is good.  I ""showed off"" the product to my family, and also used it to show them my landscaping.  :D  We also signed up for the monthly cloud-based recording solution which gives us good piece of mind, though ideally we won't have any activity that we would need to report to the police.<br><br>In short, this product works very well and not only adds an element of security to our front entry, but it is also very fun.

  Good video quality, motion detection, wifi connection. Packaging was excellent. Tools and hardware provided, big plus. Installation was straightforward. It took forever for me to drill a hole in the brick, I only had a 12 volt drill. I would recommend something with more serious power. Overall happy with the results and $30/year for cloud recording is very reasonable.

  The video and audio can be somewhat iffy at times. Have fiber optic net at 500/500 so know it’s pretty good and router is a 349 Linksys so works well. Only issue so far is a buzzing noise coming from the doorbell and occasionally it will lightly ring the bell out of the blue

3.0 out of 5 stars,Ring OK but Next Outdoor much better,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2016","<span>
  I hardwired the Ring Pro to the front of my house and installed the Nest Cam Outdoor behind my house. The Nest Cam is WAY better. The Ring is nice because it's inconspicuous without exposed wiring. It doesn't use much bandwidth because it only kicks on when it senses motion. The subscription service is also much cheaper than Nest. However, the Live View can be glitchy for no apparent reason (I have no wifi issues, full speed system). The app will only allow you to delete records individually, over time this is very annoying. I had to turn the motion sensor all the way down (from 1/2 way) because it kept picking up cars passing in front of my house which were well out of my defined zones. I also don't like that it makes the audible Ring commercial tone every time someone rings my doorbell. The Nest takes a much better picture even at 720p and the Nest App is a thousand times better and easier to use. The Nest records 24/7 so it uses more bandwidth and the subscription is much more expensive than the Ring. The only thing I really don't like about the Next is the 25 ft power cord, it's not easy to hide.

  I bought this item in January but got around to installing it in March. I had problems getting it to sync with my WiFi and while running the setup and pressing the doorbell the transformer began to hum and started getting hot. I disconnected the chime and brought to my office that has an engineering lab. They looked at it and said the coil was burned out. I bought a new chime for $42 and called an electrician to check the wiring. He found the voltage was at 18 VAC but when he pushed the button the same thing happened. He said the relay wasn't releasing so it could provide power until the WiFi connection was established. This was causing the coils to burn up so I decided to stay with my mechanical bell. I contacted Ring Pro by email to get the RMA process and was asked to provide a phone number so we could talk. I explained I was not looking for technical help but just need the RMA procedure. The response was short: ""The MAC address acts as the RMA"". I asked where to send it and how. I was told if you bought from Amazon send it there. Going to my orders I saw the ""window had closed"" for the return of this item. I wanted to contact Amazon either by email or phone but cannot find any info to do so on the WEB site. If Ring Pro and Amazon won't address my problem I'm out $250. Be careful with this product - after you buy it you own it.

  Update 8/23/2017: Dropping this product to TWO stars. Once a week the Ring Pro (even with the Chime Pro 3 feet away) drops off the network and locks up. It requires someone to physically remove the face plate and push the reset button to get it back. I am frequently out of town, and this defeats the entire purpose of having Ring. Clearly it is extremely poorly designed that it can't auto-reconnect when there's a wifi issue. No other wifi device in my house has ever acted this way. Pretty pathetic for such an expensive device that is designed to be used while you are not in the house. If this keeps happening I'll be returning it and looking elsewhere.<br><br>Update 7/22/2017: Ring Pro hasn't dropped off the network post-Chime Pro install. Now it seems very solid. However, the Windows 10 Ring app is very flakey. For example, trying to edit the motion zones is an exercise in frustration and the zones don't exactly line up with the zone placement in the iOS app. Given my false motion alerts, I think the Windows 10 Ring app zone location is probably what's really being used. Time to call tech support and see what they say. I really appreciate Ring has a native Windows 10 app, but it doesn't seem quite yet polished.<br><br>Update 7/19/2017: Chime Pro came yesterday, and took about 10 minutes to configure. Wifi signal as measured by Ring Pro is now stronger. I woke up this morning, and Ring was still functional and connected. Nearly a first in overnight operation. So I'm hopeful it will now be rock solid. I will say Ring customer service is really stellar, the best I've experienced in a consumer product in quite a while. If Ring Pro stays rock solid for a few weeks I'll bump up my review to 5 stars. But I do think the built-in wifi is very weak, as I had a Honeywell wifi thermostat literally 5 feet away from Ring Pro and it never dropped a single time in over 2 years.<br><br>Update 7/14/2017: Woke up after the first night with Ring Pro. App said it was disconnected from WiFi and there were three red LEDs on the Ring. I have a WiFi thermostat literally 4ft from the Ring Pro and it's never disconnected once in 2 years. Went through the troubleshooting steps of pushing the small button but it did NOT reset after multiple attempts. I then disconnected it from the power and reconnected it...and now the Ring Pro is dead. No sign of life whatsoever....no lights no anything. :( I called support, and we did another reset routine and it came back to life. Ring said the wifi signal was not strong, so they were sending me a Chime Pro to try.<br><br>-------<br><br>So I decided to try and fight through this and make it work. First, after my original review two Ring social media people contacted me and wanted to help me get it working. I was impressed. I decided to dispense with my original doorbell and just go with a gang box mounted transformer in conjunction with the Ring Chime. Seemed easier and less expensive. So I got my transformer wired up with the add-on Ring pro power kit and my Ring Pro sprang to life and started talking to me.<br><br>The app seems pretty good, was a breeze to configure. My only app complaint is the motion zone configuration. The bottom of the screen has a control bar that obscures part of the camera view. So it's hard to get a zone covered all the way down to the ground. Configuring multiple motion zones is easy and very slick. It would be nice to have an 'invert' zone feature where you could draw a zone you didn't want covered then invert it and have the remainder of the camera view in an active zone.<br><br>So far, I'm pretty impressed once I got over the installation hurdles. I activated the cloud storage option, so we will see how that works out.  Only time will tell how well it works out. But Ring support was excellent and so far the product seems solid. My only other hiccup was that for the first hour or so the app was reporting poor power. But after an hour or so it now shows ""very good"". I'll keep an eye on that.<br><br>I did install the Windows 10 app from the App Store, and it semi-worked. Everything except live view was functioning. I was using v1.3.810/x64. Live view from my desktop would quite handy so I hope this gets fixed. I also noticed that when the Ring Pro registers with my WiFi router the hostname is uses appears to be random (lpvdv1) and not a friendly name like RingPro or Ring-&lt;location&gt;. This could easily be fixed with a firmware update.<br><br>Original review:<br>Unfortunately my doorbell was not compatible. I looked at the Ring compatible list, but after searching through two dozen I couldn't find a single one with a built-in transformer. All needed fancy wiring for an external transformer. So needless to say, the Ring is going back for a big fail!

2.0 out of 5 stars,CANNOT detect motion in the dark,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2018","<span>
  Since there are 10k reviews on this and plenty of horn tooting, I'm just going to jump straight to the bad stuff. My beef with this doorbell is that it has a ridiculously hard time picking up motion in darkness, which is really when you want it most. If someone is trying to peak into the glass by/on your door, you want that doorbell to catch that. I've had MANY calls to customer service about this. I've had the doorbell reset, motion zones changed/rearranged, sensitivity changed (both on my end and theirs), updates pushed out, and finally a physical device replacement. It just doesn't pick up motion in the dark. What's worse than that is that, for some reason, it sees LIGHT as motion. I have an IFTTT set up so that when the doorbell detects motion after sunset, the light over the door comes on, then goes off after 5 minutes. Setting the sensitivity on the HIGHEST setting is the only way I can get it to detect motion in the dark (and that's still 50/50 at best) but on that setting, in addition to being WAY too sensitive in the day, it is triggered by the light over the door. Motion happens, light is turned on. 5 min later, light shuts off, it triggers motion. Light comes on again. It's a vicious cycle and I have to go downstairs, set off the motion, let the light come on, then immediately turn it off to break the cycle. I feel like this is a strong enough reason to remove 2 stars. I would only give it 4 stars otherwise due to the fact that you can't have offline storage and have to pay ring 3 bucks a month per device (so if you are thinking about getting stick up cams as well, add 3 bucks a month to it) to have cloud storage.

  UPDATE: November 2018.  After a year since purchase: The device NO LONGER rings my standard doorbell when the Ring button is pushed.  The video is UNSTABLE where motion is NOT detected until the person is walking away, and I'm lucky to get a still photo. The alert setting for ""PEOPLE ONLY"" is a joke. It sends notifications when a bug flies across the screen (but NOT when a person has pressed the doorbell and walked away). It ""alerts"" me when the dawn-to-dusk motion lights come on and off.  After a doorbell ring, I try to watch the Accepted Ring video and NOTHING. The icon blinks but no video.  The system is getting WORSE!<br><br>INITIAL REVIEW: The installation of the Ring Pro is pretty standard, although the Amazon video needs to be updated to reflect that there is NO orange button the back of the unit to 'sync' it with your home wireless system. It's just not there. The concept of the Pro is great -- motion detection, low light visibility, recording of visitors to your front door (or wherever you have the doorbell). The resolution is passable and the fish-eye view provides a wide range of motion capture. So, easy of installation/connection, motion detection (and associated mobile phone notifications), and wide-view are where the positives STOP. So far, after a week or two with the Ring Pro, I can say IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK!<br><br>First, the unreliable and unstable video recording and playback. I get notifications for motion at my front door. Instead of recording while there is motion, I get a freeze frame (for over a 60 seconds), with occasional sound, and frequent pressing the rudimentary interface to see what happens at my front door. Usually, the button does not work, playback is still, sound is muffled or I get no video at all. I pay $3 per month for playback on demand from my mobile phone. So far, it worked the first day, but every other encounter has some issue.<br><br>The option is there to check your wi-fi ""health"" but no fixes are available if the wi-fi is fine (strong/very strong) but the Ring is not recording or playing.This is a software/firmware issue needs to be fixed.<br><br>There is an option to get notifications via e-mail if there is a problem with accessing recorded video but, so far, I get no notifications when the unit just is not functioning. The ""Check Health"" button shows green across the board -- everything is just fine -- but I have no video, just notifications that someone is at my front door. At times when there are people AT MY FRONT DOOR, the unit THEN tells me I need to ""reset the wi-fi connection."" No notification that the wi-fi connection has been lost, disrupted, or needs reset... It just is silent. NOT a viable security option.<br><br>BOTTOM LINE: The Ring Pro is currently not designed as a key component of a security system. It is best as a basic doorbell with a video capability that may or may not work reliably. A ""nice to have"" but until it has more stable video recording, works consistently without freezing, and can alert you when it is NOT operating optimally, it is a huge disappointment. Perhaps a later version will resolve these significant issues, but until then... I do NOT recommend the purchase.

  Love this Doorbell.  I probably over-researched this doorbell, but it was the best one with the best reviews. It was a little pricy, but worth the money IMO.<br><br>Why I bought this Ring Model:<br>It's the only slim doorbell that Ring offers.  My door has a small space for a bell, the bigger ring models won't work.<br><br>Getting it working:<br>Ok, first thing is that you need to have the proper voltage at your doorbell.  I have 16 volts with 10 Volt-amps.  This is enough to run the doorbell, but barely.  With that much power, your device may drop the network or have fuzzy video.  You really need more.  If you have low power, you will have to leave your ring doorbell attached for several hours in order for it to come alive.  This is due to the design of the capacitor in the Ring doorbell.  In order to trigger your doorbell, it needs enough power, so it uses a capacitor to make sure it has enough.<br><br>I left the ring doorbell connected for 4 hours and nothing(no flashing circle).  I looked at all the troubleshooting docs and realized that I may not have enough power.<br><br>I went to my hardware store and bought a Multi-Voltage Wired Doorbell Transformer that was 24 volts/24 Volt amps.  This was not hard to install, even though I had to go under my house.  My builder put it right at the entrance to the crawlspace, so it was easy to find.<br><br>I again left it running for 4 hours and nothing.  So I called Ring troubleshooting.  Got a really knowledgeable person.  Their support to me seems top notch.  After telling the tech that I left it connected for 4 hours, he said that I may have a defective doorbell.  He told me to return it to Amazon and get another one.<br><br>I was frustrated and left the doorbell connected for 24 hours.  I came out the next morning and found the circle blinking like it should. I configured it and it worked great.  Great picture, but when I used the intercom portion, I heard a great deal of interference.  After reading people post on redit, I determined that the interference was due to a faulty doorbell.  It makes sense, Given the amount of time that it took to power up.<br><br>Side Note: I filed an exchange on Amazon, which by the way was an amazing process.  I've never exchanged something on Amazon.  It's the easiest no-hassle exchange process I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Way to go Amazon!<br><br>The new ring doorbell came, I hooked it up and immediately saw the flashing light.  Configured it and tested the intercom portion of the ring doorbell.  No interference in the audio.<br><br>Overall this product is great.  I think they could do a better job bringing the power consumption issue to light. Ring sends you paperwork to have someone install it for you.  I think it's $50.  If you have to have a new transformer, it may be more.<br><br>My wife an hyper-anal and she didn't like the color of the doorbell.  So i bought a zinc alloy doorbell angle adapter for a ring pro doorbell and painted it white.  I also spray painted the cover for the ring doorbell white to match.  Not sure why the Ring doorbell doesn't come with a white color.

It cannot use 5 GHz.<br><br>When I tested the video the quality was very poor and the video was pixelated with periods of frozen motion. This is a Wifi issue. The strength of the Wifi connection is critical. You should test that first with a cell phone held against the existing doorbell.
